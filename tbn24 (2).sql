Viewers who saw the broad smile he was unable to suppress had a clue to the answer: Republicans fear that if Hillary Clinton is nominated fairly easily, while they are locked in a bitter, lengthy, ideologically charged series of primaries with a large cast of characters of varying degrees of plausibility, she gets a head start for the real fight.</p>\r\n<p>Of course Republicans recognize that at its most vigorous, a debate between Clinton and Sanders on how &mdash; not whether &mdash; to toughen financial regulation or diminish income inequality will fall decibels short of the fundamental arguments between Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush on immigration, Lindsey Graham and Rand Paul on military intervention, Ben Carson and Mike Huckabee against many others on how sharply to press against same-sex marriage, and Donald Trump and all of the others on the role of rational discussion in politics. But they believe boosting Sanders&rsquo; candidacy is their only way to prevent Clinton emerging as the nominee with broad support early in the process, strengthening her position in November.</p>\r\n<div id="widgetMagazineGlobalSponsoredContent" class="p3Global">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p>They are correct.</p>\r\n<p>I know that there is a counter-argument made by some on the Democratic left that a closely contested nomination process will help our ultimate nominee &mdash; that Clinton will somehow benefit from having to spend most of her time and campaign funds between now and next summer proving her ideological purity in an intraparty fight, like Mitt Romney in 2012 &mdash; rather than focusing on her differences with the conservative she will face in the election. But neither an analysis of the current political situation nor the history of presidential races supports this.</p>\r\n<p>I believe strongly that the most effective thing liberals and progressives can do to advance our public policy goals &mdash; on health care, immigration, financial regulation, reducing income inequality, completing the fight against anti-LGBT discrimination, protecting women&rsquo;s autonomy in choices about reproduction and other critical matters on which the Democratic and Republican candidates for president will be sharply divided &mdash; is to help Clinton win our nomination early in the year. That way, she can focus on what we know will be a tough job: combating the flood of post-<em>Citizens United</em>&nbsp;right-wing money, in an atmosphere in which public skepticism about the effectiveness of public policy is high.</p>\r\n<p>I realize that before explaining why I am convinced that a prolonged prenomination debate about the authenticity of Clinton&rsquo;s support for progressive policy stances will do us more harm than good, that very point must be addressed. Without any substance, some argue that she has been insufficiently committed to economic and social reform &mdash; for example, that she is too close to Wall Street, and consequently soft on financial regulation, and unwilling to support higher taxation on the super-rich. This is wholly without basis. Well before the Sanders candidacy began to draw attention, she spoke out promptly in criticism of the appropriations rider that responded to the big banks&rsquo; wish list on derivative trading. She has spoken thoughtfully about further steps against abuses and in favor of taxing hedge funds at a fairer, i.e., higher, rate.</p>\r\n<p><span><br /><br />Read more:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/07/why-progressives-shouldnt-support-bernie-120484.html#ixzz3gl2IthKW">http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/07/why-progressives-shouldnt-support-bernie-120484.html#ixzz3gl2IthKW</a></span></p>', 1, '1437691759.jpg', '', 'www.kyma.com', 1, '2015-07-24 00:25:00', 'published'),

I wasn&rsquo;t a protester, but the Vietnam War was a disaster for our country. What did we get out of the Vietnam War other than death? We got nothing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>There are different kinds of heroism. To me, McCain became a hero not when he was shot down, but when he refused to be released by his North Vietnamese captors. He refused because North Vietnam intended to use the release for propaganda purposes to show how McCain, the son of an admiral, would accept special treatment. It would also demoralize the remaining POWs.</p>\r\n<p>McCain was being tortured, was near death and had attempted suicide, but, as a matter of principle, he would not accept an early release.</p>\r\n<p>To me, that&rsquo;s heroic.</p>\r\n<p>Would The Donald understand this? He would not. To him, it would be a bad deal and Trump believes only in good deals, i.e., deals that benefit him.</p>\r\n<p>What good is a principle, anyway? You can&rsquo;t eat it like caviar or drive it like a Rolls-Royce or live in it like the Trump Tower. Most of all, you can&rsquo;t gold-plate it.</p>\r\n<p>During his captivity, McCain was forced to sign a &ldquo;confession&rdquo; saying he was &ldquo;an air pirate.&rdquo; Even though other POWs signed similar confessions and even though McCain refused to sign further ones, he never forgave himself.</p>\r\n<p>He said that by signing a confession, he had given up the right ever to be called a hero.

I have stomach trouble when I think about the FIFA problem,&rsquo; he said in May.</p>\r\n<p>With eight years experience as UEFA president, he may have some strong ideas about how to reform the organisation when Blatter steps down in February.</p>\r\n<p>Yet, he has said little about what should be done to weed out corruption in FIFA. His record at UEFA, however, gives clues to how he would handle the future of a game that embraces all continents, a sport that has become a huge global business.</p>\r\n<p>One of Platini''s first moves at UEFA was to introduce a two-tier qualifying system for the flagship Champions League, making the lucrative group stage more accessible to clubs from eastern Europe and lower-ranked European countries.</p>\r\n<p>He resisted pressure to introduce technology to help with refereeing decisions, instead preferring an innovative system of extra officials on each goal line.</p>\r\n<p>Other UEFA policies have shown a less romantic, less ''purist'', more businesslike side to Platini.</p>\r\n<p>Some critics have accused him of turning UEFA into a slick, financially successful and yet ultimately charmless organization, where elite clubs have thrived and others have to sell their best players to stay afloat.</p>\r\n<p><span>FAIR PLAY</span></p>\r\n<p>Under his leadership, UEFA has steered money and power to precisely the clubs and leagues that are already the most established, particularly through the market pool system where club revenue depends on the size of their country''s television market.</p>\r\n<p>This has led to the same few teams dominating the Champions League, shutting out smaller outfits such as French provincial side St Etienne, who won the last of their league titles back in 1981 when Platini was in their team.</p>\r\n<p>Another controversial policy was the introduction of UEFA''s complicated Financial Fair Play rules, a system yet to be proven to really achieve its aims.</p>\r\n<p>Devised to stop rich owners buying success by splurging on top players, it also forces smaller clubs to sell stars to bigger rivals to balance their books.</p>\r\n<p>Platini the pragmatist knows he cannot afford to upset the powerful European clubs who have formed their own organization, initially known as the G-14 and now expanded to the European Clubs'' Association (ECA), to look after their interests.</p>\r\n<p>He also has to keep Europe''s smaller national federations happy as they hold the votes in UEFA elections.</p>\r\n<p>Blatter, who denies all suggestions of corruption and is not among those indicted, gained great popularity beyond Europe, especially in the national federations of Africa, for his promotion of soccer there.</p>\r\n<p>Should Platini become FIFA president, he would have to balance the influence and power of Europe and non-European soccer powers. At least for his early years, however, corruption investigations would hang over all his efforts.</p>\r\n<p>Several executive committee members have been banned for improper conduct by FIFA''s own ethics committee while U.S authorities have indicted 14 people, some of them former FIFA officials, on counts of money laundering and bribery.</p>\r\n<p>Swiss authorities are investigating the decisions to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar respectively.</p>\r\n<p>The Swiss attorney general''s office says it already has 81 reports of suspicious transactions related to the decisions. Investigations could take years, leaving whoever succeeds Blatter to deal with the fallout.</p>\r\n<p>Platini, part of the FIFA executive committee since 2002, himself voted for Qatar, despite FIFA''s own technical report flagging up concerns about the searing heat in the Gulf state.</p>\r\n<p>However, Pedro Pinto, UEFA''s spokesman, said on Monday that Platini stood by his decision even though it left him vulnerable to criticism.</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;He''s a man of conviction, he''s a man who has always been transparent and one of the few, if not the only one, to admit who he voted for,&rsquo; he said.</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;He has nothing to hide and is someone who I think is respected around the world of football.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="tags_list">&nbsp;</div>', 12, '1437782388.jpg', '', 'asfaggdha', 1, '2015-07-25 11:08:09', 'published'),

If you are not in the top eight you can get a top player in a really early round.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>Nadal, plagued by injury and illness at the end of last season, is still searching for his first title on the European clay in 2015.</p>\r\n<p>But he is hopeful for more improvement in Rome after playing some of his best tennis of the year in reaching the final in Madrid.</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;I cannot leave Madrid unhappy. I have to forget what happened today and remain with the positives,&rsquo; said the 28-year-old.</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;There were more good things than bad this week and I will try to recover those good sensations in Rome.</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;I think I''ve made a step forward, I am playing better. This season I haven''t played two good weeks in a row and now is the time to do that.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>Murray, meanwhile, admitted his recent marriage to long-term girlfriend Kim Sears has helped his incredible start to the clay court season.</p>\r\n<p>Two-time major winner Murray is 9-0 since getting married last month.</p>\r\n<p>The Scottish star even wrote &lsquo;marriage works&rsquo; on the on-court camera after thrashing nine-time French Open champion Nadal.</p>\r\n<p>Murray has also taken to wearing his wedding ring on the laces of his shoes during matches although he was quick to put it back on his finger after sealing victory over Nadal.</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;I think people don''t always appreciate that sports people have another part of our lives that is very important to our performance,&rsquo; said Murray.</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;If you''re happy away from the court and you''re private and personal life is good that will help everything.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;So that obviously for me is very good right now. That helps performance, but you still need to put in the hard work as well, which I did in Barcelona and Munich before here and I''ve been rewarded for that.&rsquo;</p>', 13, '1437786619.jpg', '', 'afesdjkl', 1, '2015-07-25 11:12:36', 'published'),

(106, 'Astronomers discover most Earth-like planet yet', '<p><span>Cape Canaveral:</span>&nbsp;A planet believed to be remarkably similar to Earth has been discovered orbiting a distant sun-like star, bolstering hopes of finding life elsewhere in the universe, US scientists said on Thursday.</p>\r\n<p>The planet, which is about 60 per cent bigger than Earth, is located 1,400 light years away in the constellation Cygnus. It was discovered by astronomers using NASA&rsquo;s Kepler space telescope and circles a star that is similar in size and temperature to the sun, but older.</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;In my mind, this is the closest thing we have to another planet like the Earth,&rsquo; astronomer Jon Jenkins, with the US space agency&rsquo;s Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California, told reporters on a conference call. The planet, dubbed Kepler-452b, orbits a star that is about 6 billion years old, compared to the 4.6 billion year age of the sun. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s simply awe-inspiring to consider that this planet has spent 6 billion years in the habitable zone of its star,&rsquo; Jenkins said.</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s considerable time and opportunity for life to arise somewhere on its surface or in its oceans should all the necessary ingredients and conditions for life exist on this planet,&rsquo; he said.</p>\r\n<p>Kepler-452b is positioned about as far from its parent star as Earth is from the sun, completing an orbit in 385 days, compared to Earth&rsquo;s 365-day orbit. At that distance, surface temperatures would be suitable for liquid water, a condition believed to be critical for life. Scientists previously have found Earth-sized planets orbiting in stars&rsquo; so-called &lsquo;habitable zones,&rsquo; but those stars are cooler and smaller than the sun, a G2 type yellow star.</p>\r\n<p>NASA launched the Kepler telescope in 2009 to survey a sampling of nearby stars in an attempt to learn if planets like Earth were common in the galaxy.</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;This is great progress in finding a planet like Earth that is similar in size and temperature around a sun-like star,&rsquo; said Kepler scientist Jeff Coughlin, with the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California. Based on its size, scientists believe Kepler-452b should be rocky, like the Earth, though that theory is based on statistical analysis and computer modelling, not direct evidence.</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;With a radius 60 percent larger than the Earth, this planet has a somewhat better than even chance of being rocky,&rsquo; Jenkins said.</p>\r\n<p>If so, Kepler-452b could be about five times as massive as Earth and have gravity that is twice as strong as what exists on Earth&rsquo;s surface. The planet also could have a thick atmosphere, cloudy skies and active volcanoes, Jenkins said.</p>\r\n<p>With the discovery of Kepler-452b, the telescope has found 1,030 confirmed planets and identified about 4,700 candidate planets. The list of potential planets includes 11 other near-Earth twins, nine of which circle sun-like stars.</p>\r\n<p>The telescope cannot see planets directly, but measures minute changes in light coming from target stars. Sophisticated computer programs and follow-up observations with a ground-based telescopes then determine if some of the light dips were caused by planets passing in front of their parent stars, relative to Kepler&rsquo;s line of sight.</p>\r\n<p>A positioning system failure ended the telescope&rsquo;s prime planet-hunting mission in 2013, but it has since been repurposed for other astronomical observations.</p>\r\n<p>Attempts to learn if Kepler-452b has an atmosphere likely will have to wait for a new generation of more sensitive space telescopes, said NASA&rsquo;s associate administrator John Grunsfeld. The research will be published in The Astronomical Journal.</p>', 18, '1437792092.jpg', '', 'sdfsadgasd', 1, '2015-07-25 10:41:40', 'published'),

Kerala farmers lose at least 250 crore rupees (around $40 million) each year due to mastitis in crossbreed varieties, according to researchers at the animal husbandry department.</p>\r\n<p>According to the 2012 Kerala livestock census, not a single case of severe mastitis has been reported among dwarf cows.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Quality, Not Quantity</span></p>\r\n<p>Still, many commercial cattle farmers are sceptical about the benefits of downsizing to dwarves. Of the 2.3 million cattle in Kerala, only 6.5% are dwarf varieties, agricultural experts say.</p>\r\n<p>One issue is cost. A dwarf cow costs almost the same as a larger crossbred &mdash; about 20,000 rupees (Tk&nbsp;24581). But a crossbreed cow, when it is healthy, produces much more milk than its dwarf counterpart, making crossbreeds a popular choice among farmers.</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;I am concerned about the commercial aspects,&rsquo; said K Ravindran, a farmer from Palakkad. &lsquo;In order to produce 10 litres of milk, a farmer has to rear at least four Vechur cows instead of one crossbreed.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>But Basha Balakrishnan, a farmer living in Calicut, argues that customers are willing to pay more for milk from dwarf cows. Her dairy herd includes 35 crossbreeds and 15 dwarf varieties, and she says she can sell a litre of milk from the smaller animals for three times as much as the larger cows.</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;Though dwarf milk is costlier, many people &mdash; especially the rich who live in flats in Calicut &mdash; are eager to purchase it because it is thought to be more nutritious than crossbred milk,&rsquo; she said.</p>\r\n<p>Balakrishnan&rsquo;s dwarf cows are even famous. One of her Vechur cows was recently featured in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world&rsquo;s shortest cow at a height of 61cm (24 inches).</p>\r\n<p>With India facing growing heat and drought threats, other state governments have reached out to learn more about Kerala&rsquo;s dwarf cows as a way to help protect their own cattle and dairy industries.</p>\r\n<p>Government officials from the state of Gujarat recently bought three Vechur cows from Kerala, while Punjab Chief Minister Prakesh Singh Badal took six dwarf cows from Kerala to his farm in Chandigarh, livestock experts say.</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;It is a fact that the characteristics of the seasons have been altered by the disastrous impacts of climate change, so our lifestyle needs to adapt to using our indigenous flora and fauna,&rsquo; said K. Ramankutty, a dairy farmer in Palakkad.</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;The dwarf cow is a great weapon against climate change,&rsquo; he said.</p>', 18, '1437792761.jpg', '', 'afadsfgasd', 1, '2015-07-25 12:13:05', 'published'),

Stop indulging in dairy products or sugar, says an expert.</p>\r\n<p>Kiran Lohia, medical director of Lumiere Dermatology, New Delhi, suggests what not to eat for healthy skin:</p>\r\n<p><span>No dairy products:</span>&nbsp;Most people believe that &ldquo;milk does a body good", but the fact is that it is more harmful than you think. Dairy products such as milk, cheese, ice cream and yogurt are full of hormones. Acne, ageing and pigmentation are all caused or worsened by hormonal imbalance, so adding even more hormones from your food creates the problem! Nearly all dermatologists will tell their patients to cut out the dairy products as much as possible. For those of you scared of not getting enough calcium, did you know that spinach has more calcium than milk?</p>\r\n<p><span>No sugar:</span>&nbsp;Sugar is known to cause glycation of important proteins in the skin. Through glycation, these strength and youth-giving proteins become inactive, leading to worsening of skin sagging and wrinkles. For those of you with a sweet tooth, substituting for sugar free is not the answer. Sugar free options have a host of issues themselves, and cause just as much as an insulin reaction as sugar does. For truly gorgeous youthful skin, keeping it clean and natural and without sugar is the way to go.</p>\r\n<p><span>No artificial ingredients:</span>&nbsp;Eating excessively processed foods with untested additives can only damage your system in ways that we are only just beginning to understand. Trying to keep your diet simple and true to nature at least 80 percent of the time will make a big difference in your body and your skin. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>No white foods:</span>&nbsp;White flour and corn starch, present in everything from pasta to namkeen, are a huge cause of insulin dysregulation. These foods have no nutritional value. They just taste good. And in the process, cause your insulin to spike, while causing your stress hormones to skyrocket. You remember what your skin used to look like as a teenager before a test? Those pimples, that dullness and that skin sensitivity? Well that happens because your stress hormones have shot up through the roof.

Removing sugary and starchy products from your diet will help you control acne and will keep you healthy in the long run.</p>\r\n<p><span>Avoid stress:</span>&nbsp;Physical as well as emotional stress has been proven to trigger acne breakouts in some people. Try and reduce stress.</p>\r\n<p><span>Wrong cosmetics:</span>&nbsp;Another common factor responsible for causing acne is the use of certain kinds of cosmetics and cleansing products. Avoid using greasy or harsh products or those whose ingredients you are allergic to. These products tend to clog your skin pores and irritate your skin, and result in acne breakouts.</p>\r\n<p><span>Wipe your sweat:</span>&nbsp;When you are out in the hot sun, you tend to sweat a lot. Your sweat contains toxins and impurities, so make sure you have a towel handy to wipe off the greasy sweat. Sweating keeps your skin cleansed naturally, but needs to be wiped off at regular intervals in order to prevent acne breakouts.</p>\r\n<p><span>Facial hygiene:</span>&nbsp;Wash your face with a gentle cleanser at regular intervals. Splashing fresh water on your facial skin rejuvenates it and the hydration prevents acne and pimples.</p>\r\n<p><span>Include fruits and vegetables in your diet:</span>&nbsp;Eat a lot of green vegetables and fresh fruits. These foods not only work wonders for your overall health, they are also vital sources of antioxidants, vitamins and other essential nutrients that erase the signs of acne and heal acne-ridden skin.</p>\r\n<p><span>Hydration:</span>&nbsp;Make sure you drink lots of water throughout the day. Water flushes out toxins and other impurities from your system and keeps your skin cleansed and hydrated.</p>\r\n<p><span>Avoid a sedentary lifestyle:</span>&nbsp;Try and remain physically active. Yoga and exercise improve your skin and boost metabolism.</p>\r\n<p><span>Wear comfortable clothing:</span>&nbsp;Wear loose clothes that do not irritate your skin. Prevent acne breakouts by avoiding the heat, friction and constant pressure caused by restrictive headgear or other forms of athletic gear. Switch to cotton clothing instead of wearing synthetic.</p>\r\n<p><span>Clean up after exercise:</span>&nbsp;Make sure you shower after exercising to get the sweat and grime off as soon as possible. When you sweat after a serious workout, there is an accumulation of dead cells on the surface of your skin. It is essential to remove these immediately to avoid blockages which can then lead to acne breakouts.</p>', 20, '1437855473.jpg', '', 'aSdghj', 1, '2015-07-25 12:54:16', 'published');

Experts say one should go for the generic varieties or make alternatives more interesting.</p>\r\n<p>It''s difficult to stop children from eating their favourite noodles or fast food, so put in extra effort, suggests Aarchie Bhatnagar, dietician at BLK Super Speciality Hospital here.</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;Mothers can buy plain raw noodles and cook, adding vegetables to make the dish healthy. Momos or burgers can be also made at home by replacing maida with rice floor,&rsquo; says Bhatnagar.</p>\r\n<p>But what about pesticides, contaminants and germs in raw food bought locally. From the farm to the table, our food passes through different processes and different hands.</p>\r\n<p>Experts advise that vegetables and fruits should be washed well. Peeling fruits will cut down surface pesticide content. The water-soluble compound potassium permanganate may also come to your aid.</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;Mix enough of the permanganate in water to give it a light pink colour. Soak fruits and vegetables and rinse them well. This will effectively remove pesticides, bacteria and other pests,&rsquo; advises Kanika Malhotra, senior clinical nutritionist from HealthCare at Home (India), a global venture offering home health care services.</p>\r\n<p>Too much of the permanganate, though, can be harmful so ensure that the water colour is light pink and not dark, she adds. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Sonia Bajaj, an acclaimed nutritionist and fitness expert advises that suma tablets (chlorine-based sanitising tablets) may be used to clean or sanitise vegetables and salads. Even vinegar can help, she adds.</p>\r\n<p>Another option for healthy food at home is to look for a good ultrasonic food washer. This washer uses the principle of ultrasonic and reactive oxygen to remove most of agricultural chemicals from fruits and vegetables.</p>\r\n<p>It also removes fungicides, pesticides and contaminants and has been found to be quite effective, says Ritika Samaddar, head (dietetics) at Max Super Speciality Hospital in Delhi. &lsquo;The cost, however, is an issue and cannot be a solution for the masses,&rsquo; explains Samaddar. The price of a washer starts at around Rs 7,000.</p>\r\n<p>But should vegetables and other food items be bought only from reputed grocery stores? According to Bhatnagar, one should only buy food items from reputed stores as they have certain basic hygienic standards in place. &lsquo;This will ensure certain purity but adulteration-free food cannot be guaranteed,&rsquo; she maintains.</p>\r\n<p>For Samaddar, &rsquo;buying even from a local vender is fine provided the fruits or vegetables are washed properly before consumption&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p>Organic food is another choice. An organic product is considered truly organic when it is duly certified and contains 95 percent or more organic ingredients.</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;Organic foods will mostly be without pesticides and more nutritious per serving. But these are more expensive, hence not an option for the public, Samaddar says. She advises that one should look for certification, wherever possible, from Food Safety and Standards Authority of India or ISO. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>What are the other ways to ensure that healthy food items reach our table? Read food labels carefully and do not get fooled by gimmicks. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;Check how much fat or sugar is there in the food. Just saying ''contains oats'' and actually ''containing four percent per 100 gms'' is not justified,&rsquo; Malhotra points out. As a rule, the more processed the food is, the more toxic it is likely to be. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>But what about the children''s craving for junk food. Samaddar says junk food can also be made healthy by incorporating some simple changes at home.</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;Use a wheat crust for your pizza and top it up with lots of crunchy veggies. Have a whole wheat bun and add lettuce with your patty to make it more healthy,&rsquo; she says.</p>\r\n<p>Malhotra suggests that parents can ensure that kids eat healthy at home. Start the day with fruit and a handful of nuts. For breakfast, pack upma, poha, stuffed veggies, chapati roll or sandwich. Keep lunch simple with a roti or rice, sabzi and dal.</p>\r\n<p>In the evenings, give them a glass of milk and another fruit.</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;Make dinner interesting with a bowl of soup, stuffed rolls with chopped tomatoes and pav bhaji minus butter, with whole wheat bread/barbecued or tandoori chicken/paneer with a bowl of soup and salad,&rsquo; says Malhotra.</p>\r\n<p>Once the kid is full, he or she will not look for junk food.

Dry hands with a clean towel. Make a habit of wearing an apron in the kitchen. Avoid cooking and touching food items if you have cold, runny nose or fever. Before handling food, make sure that all cooking surfaces are spotlessly clean. Wash all utensils with soap and water. Preferably use a separate chopping board for meat.</p>\r\n<p><span>* Clean your produce:</span>&nbsp;With the growing concern about pesticide residues remaining on the surface of fruits and vegetables, it will be a good idea to soak them in lukewarm water with some salt and vinegar for two hours. Before eating (fruits) or cooking (vegetables), wash them under running tap water to get rid of any last traces of pesticides.</p>\r\n<p><span>* Maintain correct temperature:</span>&nbsp;This is the most relevant tip for maintaining food safety during the hot summer months. The temperature of the refrigerator must be maintained at four degree celsius and the freezer at -15 to -18 degree celsius. Store away raw meat and poultry in the freezer compartment.</p>\r\n<p>When required, thaw out in the refrigerator compartment itself, but separate from other items of food. Make sure to thaw the meat thoroughly. Marinate the meat in the fridge; use the sauce only for cooking, and not for serving. Never serve cooked meat on the same plate used for marinating. Once served, food should not be kept outside for more than two hours. If eating outdoors, use a chiller box with plenty of ice packs. Use separate boxes for food and beverages. Avoid opening the box too often to maintain the cool temperature inside. Also, avoid exposure of the chiller box to direct sunlight.</p>\r\n<p><span>* Safety tips for outdoor picnics:</span>&nbsp;Food safety begins with proper hand cleaning - including outdoor settings. Before you begin setting out your picnic feast, make sure hands and surfaces are clean. If you don&rsquo;t have access to running water, simply use a water jug, soap, and paper towels; or consider using disposable wet wipes for cleaning hands.</p>', 21, '1437856977.jpg', '', 'fdhgh', 1, '2015-07-25 12:58:10', 'published'),

You just need to follow a few travel beauty survival tips.</p>\r\n<p>Makeup artist Kanikka Gauraav Tandon suggests how:</p>\r\n<p><span>* Go with a moisturiser:</span>&nbsp;Apply heavier moisturiser a day before you are going to travel. This will help in maintaining hydration in your skin before you are exposed to dehydrating effects of cabin pressure or air conditioner effects.</p>\r\n<p><span>* Tie high:</span>&nbsp;Tie a high pony or a high bun to combat bad hair at the end of the long flight. And make sure to carry a wide tooth hair brush always.</p>\r\n<p><span>* Drizzle with mineral water:</span>&nbsp;To give a touch up while travelling, never add extra foundation or blush, instead drizzle mineral water and add a bit of moisturiser.</p>\r\n<p><span>* Pick nude colours:</span>&nbsp;Avoid bright coloured nail polish while travelling as it chips too easily and gives an unfinished look. Instead, go for neutral, sheer colour or a nude hue that won&rsquo;t call for attention even if it chips.</p>\r\n<p><span>* Take your cleanser:</span>&nbsp;If you can carry just a single skin care item from home, go for your cleanser as change in cleansers can abrupt skin&rsquo;s acid balance and results in breakout.</p>\r\n<p><span>* Keep hands away from face:</span>&nbsp;To avoid breakouts, make sure not to touch your skin while travelling as your hands carry numerous bacteria resulting in many skin problems. Use anti-bacterial hand wash before applying makeup.</p>\r\n<p><span>* A big no to eye makeup:</span>&nbsp;Avoid mascara and creamy eye shadows. People often take a nap while travelling, so these might trail down to cheeks. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>* Don''t stick to lipstick:</span>&nbsp;People prefer using long lasting lipstick, but this really dehydrates your lips and so as to have an escape go for lip gloss. Re-apply the gloss throughout the trip and your lips will look fresh.</p>', 23, 'images (6).jpg', '', 'safdsafa', 1, '2015-08-10 10:18:37', 'published'),

(192, 'Addicted to antibiotics, Chileâ€™s salmon flops', '<p>Santiago: Chile&rsquo;s salmon farmers are using record levels of antibiotics to treat a virulent and pervasive bacteria, driving away some US retailers including Costco Wholesale Corp, which is turning to antibiotic-free Norwegian salmon.</p>\r\n<p>The coastal waters of Chile, the world&rsquo;s second-largest producer of salmon, are awash with a bacteria known as SRS, or Piscirickettsiosis. The bacteria causes lesions and hemorrhaging in infected fish, and swells their kidneys and spleens, eventually killing them.</p>\r\n<p>Unable to develop an effective vaccine, Chilean farmers have been forced to increase antibiotic use. In 2014, the industry produced around 895,000 tonnes of fish and used 563,200 kilograms (1.2 million pounds) of antibiotics, according to government and industry data. Antibiotic use had risen 25 percent from 2013.</p>\r\n<p>In contrast, Norway, the world&rsquo;s largest salmon producer, produced around 1.3 million tonnes of fish and used 972 kilos of antibiotics in 2013. (Figures for last year were not immediately available)</p>\r\n<p>Chilean officials say their salmon is safe and the antibiotics have been approved by U.S. food and drug regulators.</p>\r\n<p>Still, amid growing concerns in the U.S. food industry that heavy use of antibiotics in animals can spawn drug-resistant superbugs and endanger human health, Costco told Reuters in April that it would reduce imports of Chilean salmon.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The whole industry is starting to shift,&rdquo; said Jeff Lyons, who oversees fresh foods at Costco, the No. 3 U.S. retailer.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;If I was to ask you your biggest concern on produce, you might say pesticides. When we ask people in protein, generally it&rsquo;s going to be hormones or antibiotics.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Costco used to buy 90 percent of the 600,000 pounds of salmon fillet it needs per week from Chile, accounting for about 8.5 percent of Chilean salmon exports to the United States. Costco said it intends to buy 60 percent of its salmon from Norway, cutting Chilean imports to 40 percent.</p>\r\n<p>A former executive at a Chilean salmon producer said Costco&rsquo;s move could hurt the local industry&rsquo;s reputation and spur other retailers to follow suit.</p>\r\n<p>In recent years, U.S. grocery chains Whole Foods Market Inc and Trader Joe&rsquo;s have gradually phased out Chilean farm salmon in favor of antibiotic-free fish caught in the wild.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;This is the beginning of a change in seafood,&rdquo; said Tobias Aguirre, the executive director of FishWise, a seafood consultancy that works with retailers such as Safeway and Target Corp. Target has also eliminated farmed salmon from its shelves.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Other retailers will look at their lead and try to better understand why Costco made this move, and I think they will follow,&rdquo; Aguirre said.</p>\r\n<p><span>Chile Vs Norway</span></p>\r\n<p>To be sure, not every salmon buyer is that worried about antibiotics. Chile exported $4.4 billion worth of salmon in 2014, up 24 percent from the previous year, according to industry group SalmonChile.</p>\r\n<p>For some buyers, costs are paramount. Brazil&rsquo;s biggest retailer, GPA SA, which buys some 3.6 million kilograms of Chilean salmon per year, said demand for antibiotic-free fish in the South American giant is small, and the high cost of importing from Norway is a deterrent.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The greatest demand in the Brazilian market is for fresh salmon, purchased, for now, from Chile mainly due to logistics,&rdquo; GPA said in an email.</p>\r\n<p>Chilean salmon producers said there is no reason for consumers to worry. Farmers do not administer antibiotics for months before harvesting the fish, so any traces of the drugs that remain in the salmon when it reaches consumers are within tolerance levels, they said.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The final product consumers eat has no antibiotics,&rdquo; said Ricardo Garcia, chief executive of salmon producer Camanchaca , which reported nearly $500 million in sales last year.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;This is only something given to sick fish so they don&rsquo;t die. It&rsquo;s not something preventive,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said in a statement that inspections of Chilean salmon have not found unapproved drug residues this fiscal year, which began on Oct. 1, and &ldquo;any article of food that appears to be adulterated or misbranded at importation is refused admission&rdquo; into the country.</p>\r\n<p><span>Government Recognizes Problem</span></p>\r\n<p>In recent months, the U.S. food industry has taken an increasingly tough stance against antibiotics due to concerns that overuse may diminish their effectiveness in fighting disease in humans. Wal-Mart Stores Inc, for instance, is pressing meat, seafood, dairy and egg suppliers to reduce their use of antibiotics.</p>\r\n<p>Speaking in general terms, the FDA said it has &ldquo;concerns about the improper use of medically important antibiotics in food products derived from animals, as this practice is one factor that can contribute to antimicrobial resistance in humans.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Antibiotic-resistant strains of the SRS bacteria have emerged in Chile&rsquo;s salmon farms, according to a November 2014 study on the government&rsquo;s National Fisheries website.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The bacteria will respond for a few years to the antibiotics treatment but afterward will become stronger and resistant,&rdquo; said Alex Munoz, vice president for South America at the Oceana environmental group in Chile.</p>\r\n<p>Salmon producers in Chile say they are aware they should reduce their dependence on antibiotics, but they do not expect a significant change since efforts to find an SRS vaccine have so far been unsuccessful.</p>\r\n<p>In Norway, intensive research has produced vaccines against most bacterial infections found in salmon farms.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re faced with a reality in Chile, unlike Norway, where we haven&rsquo;t developed vaccines for the Chilean market, leading us to often correct things with the use of antibiotics,&rdquo; said Gerardo Balbontin, chief executive of Blumar, which exports a tenth of its salmon production to Costco.</p>\r\n<p>The government acknowledges it has a problem on its hands.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The use of antibiotics is an issue for us,&rdquo; said Eugenio Zamorano, head of Chile&rsquo;s aquaculture department. &ldquo;All companies (in Chile) use antibiotics to a lesser or greater extent.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>As well as working towards finding a vaccine, Zamorano said &ldquo;genetic improvements&rdquo; in salmon could be part of the solution.

Other British defence contractors may also be involved, they said.</p>\r\n<p>All three sources spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject.</p>\r\n<p>Both Babcock and BAE declined to say whether they would work with the consortium, the builders of Japan&rsquo;s 4,000-ton Soryu diesel-electric submarine, on the Australian project.</p>\r\n<p>A spokesman for Japan&rsquo;s defence ministry said the Japanese bidders were responding to Australia&rsquo;s desire to have as much local participation as possible in the project.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;With Mitsubishi Heavy taking the lead, we are gathering information from both Japanese and foreign companies in regard to Australian industry but we are unable to disclose any specific names,&rdquo; the spokesman said.</p>\r\n<p>Both Babcock and BAE Systems are well established in Australia.

The bidders were well aware of this, they said.</p>\r\n<p>According to a company document seen by Reuters, the German bidder TKMS will train local contractors using advanced German manufacturing and production technology and help establish Australia as a naval shipbuilding and repair hub in the Asia-Pacific region. The document is to be shared privately with Australian government ministers as part of the proposal.</p>\r\n<p>That is an attractive proposition for a country still reeling from the decision by Ford Motor Co, Toyota Motor Corp and General Motors Co to halt local production in 2016.</p>\r\n<p>Two TKMS executives told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday that the Australian government would struggle politically to turn down the economic incentives built into their proposal.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an awful lot of politicians across the board ... that will not be very politically happy if this A$50 billion life cost sophisticated programme goes to solve Japan&rsquo;s deficit problem,&rdquo; TKMS Australia Chairman John White told Reuters.</p>\r\n<p>Senator Sean Edwards - chairman of the economics committee in the upper house of Australia&rsquo;s parliament - said that no government could say yes to any proposal that did not offer significant economic benefits for Australia.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s compelling (to build the submarines in Australia). And I think this is a problem for Japan,&rdquo; Edwards told Reuters.</p>\r\n<p>However, Australia&rsquo;s Abbot has described Japan as his country&rsquo;s &ldquo;closest friend in Asia&rdquo;. With the United States also keen to spur friendlier ties between its two key allies in Asia, Tokyo has Washington&rsquo;s backing for made-in-Japan submarines packed with American surveillance, radar and weapons equipment, sources familiar with Washington&rsquo;s thinking told Reuters earlier.</p>\r\n<p>Each of the bidders have been asked to provide three estimates; one for construction overseas, one for a partial assembly in Australia and one for a full build in an Australian shipyard.

But however vexing it may be to watch powerful figures use the blame game to justify their bad actions, the strategy is proving wildly successful.</p>\r\n<p>In descending order of cursedness, militant Islam takes the first prize. Their grievances are plentiful.</p>\r\n<p>The West, led by the United States, wages incessant war against&nbsp; Muslims,&nbsp; cries Islamic State spokesman Abu Mohammed al Adnani, who says disbelievers must be killed wherever found: &lsquo;Smash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him, or poison him.&rsquo;&nbsp; The same fate awaits those Muslims who do not agree with Islamic State: &lsquo;We fight the disbelievers amongst them, the allies of the crusaders and Jews in their war against the Muslims.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>Hamas, for its part, believes the Israelis must be killed for taking their land. Khalid Mishal, leader of Hamas, told Vanity Fair last October, &lsquo;We do not kill Israelis because they are Jews. We kill them because they are occupiers. They occupied our land and have transgressed against us. This falls in the context of self-defense and defending our land.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>And finally journalists, according to militant Islamists, must be killed when they insult the Prophet. A now-deceased official of al Qaeda in Yemen, Harith al Nadhari, said after his colleagues had killed 17 journalists at the magazine Charlie Hebdo and at a kosher supermarket in Paris in January that &lsquo;the leadership of AQAP [al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula] directed the operations and they have chosen their target carefully&hellip; [Osama bin Laden had warned about] the consequences of persistence in blasphemy against Muslim sanctities.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>The ambition of many of these militant Islamist groups &mdash; to establish a caliphate that will erase the borders between Middle Eastern states and unite Muslims in one religiously conducted state; the killing of the population of Israel; the silencing through terror or murder of all material which is held to insult Mohammed or Islam &mdash; are presented not as autonomous projects but as duties on the faithful.</p>\r\n<p>Earlier this week, UK Prime Minister David Cameron announced measures to be taken against those who preached &ndash; not necessarily practiced &ndash; violence against Western states, and expressed militant opposition to liberal and democratic values. It&rsquo;s an announcement full of dangers to free speech. It also reflects the desperation governments feel, now faced with the substantial defection of a new generation of Muslim youth &ndash; British, French, German, Italian, American &ndash; who watch executions and bombings on their computer screens, and find them good. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>But Islamic State is not alone in employing the &lsquo;poor us&rsquo; approach.</p>\r\n<p>Russia is now &mdash; according to experts&rsquo; reports &mdash; preparing for a new, not too disguised, military campaign against Ukraine. For President Vladimir Putin, the need to oppose the Ukrainian government is caused by Western governments having installed in Kiev a fascist regime bent on oppressing Ukraine&rsquo;s Russian-speaking population.</p>\r\n<p>These same evil Western forces have infiltrated into Russia their ideas, designed to destabilize the present administration, working through both Russian civil society organizations and foreign non-governmental organizations like Transparency International and Human Rights Watch , spreading subversive ideas like democracy, clean government and observation of human rights. Or so Putin would have his people believe.</p>\r\n<p>This aggressive passivity is playing tremendously well for the Russian president. Last month, his popularity rating as measured by the independent Levada Centre reached 89 percent, the highest ever recorded. He has touched a vast theme in Russian life &mdash; that of being beset by enemies but fighting bravely, and as one people, against them.</p>\r\n<p>The Ukrainian government is not fascist and the NGOs, Russian or foreign, in no way threaten his or any other government. But the narrative works brilliantly.</p>\r\n<p>The most vivid case of what might be called false blame syndrome comes from the present government of Greece, the Syriza party of Alexis Tsipras. Throughout the months of red-eye negotiations, Tsipras played on one theme: that the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and the other creditors &lsquo;were blackmailing us with their loans.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>Tsipras has also charged the EU and the IMF with seeking regime change in Athens by denying him the agreement he wanted. Even after &mdash; successfully &mdash; calling on the parliament to back the deal, Tsipras continues to call it blackmail. To be sure, it&rsquo;s a terrible deal &mdash; but as the Swedish economist Anders Pazlov writes , Greece&rsquo;s future in or out of the euro is awful, and its problems (bad tax collection, corruption, a slow and erratic justice system and a lethargic, over-padded state bureaucracy) remain largely untackled.</p>\r\n<p>Still, Tsipras not only won the vote, but also remained popular. Not at Putin-style levels &mdash; and down from his own best of over 70 percent &mdash; but a respectable 60 percent, 10 percent ahead of his nearest rival.</p>\r\n<p>Every one of these strategies &ndash; that of the violent Islamists, the Russian president and the Greek prime minister &ndash; is popular with the target audience. These audiences are willing to ignore the hardships that their leaders have been largely or partly responsible for bringing on or deepening, and in the case of the Islamists, seem to positively like the violence displayed.</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s not my fault &ndash; it&rsquo;s them.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s the new/old slogan, which may soon be taught in leadership seminars.</p>', 31, 'whining_militants.jpg', '', 'aggaagga', 1, '2015-08-11 14:22:42', 'published'),
(241, 'Greece will struggle to stay in euro', '<p>The question Greeks answered on Sunday&rsquo;s referendum ballot paper didn&rsquo;t mention the euro. But after the people gave an emphatic &lsquo;No&rsquo; to proposals from the country&rsquo;s creditors, Greece will struggle to stay in the single currency. Even if it does, all routes will bring economic hardship and social tension.</p>\r\n<p>The first way of avoiding a reversion to Greece&rsquo;s pre-euro currency would be if euro zone partners and the International Monetary Fund cut Alexis Tsipras a significantly better deal than they were offering 10 days ago. This is what the radical left prime minister said would result from a &lsquo;No&rsquo; vote. The government even promised to do a deal within 48 hours.</p>\r\n<p>But the creditors probably won&rsquo;t buckle. They would prefer to keep Greece in the euro if possible &ndash; for both financial and geopolitical reasons. But many of the leaders are fed up with Athens&rsquo; rhetoric and negotiating style. The day before the referendum, for example, Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis accused them of terrorism. Parliamentarians and electorates in some countries, such as Germany, are hostile to the idea of granting more soft loans to Greece.</p>\r\n<p>The euro zone countries seem to have steeled themselves to the likelihood of a &lsquo;Grexit&rsquo; since talks broke down. Since then, despite the fact that Greece has closed its banks, financial contagion has been minimal. Several countries such as Spain will be nervous that, if they now cut Athens a soft deal, radical parties in their own countries will grow in strength.</p>\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, since Tsipras called his referendum, the country&rsquo;s old bailout programme has expired and the country&rsquo;s economic prospects have deteriorated. A comprehensive new deal for Greece would probably require around 70 billion euros. It is hard to see why the creditors would lend such a large sum of money to a government they don&rsquo;t trust.</p>\r\n<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean that the euro zone will refuse to talk to Greece. But they are likely to take a measured approach rather than snapping to attention. They probably won&rsquo;t rush to provide debt relief, one of Tsipras&rsquo; key demands. They will also attach lots of conditions to any money they lend and insist on intrusive monitoring. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank seems unlikely to increase the amount of liquidity it is providing to Greece&rsquo;s banks.</p>\r\n<p>All this will be frustrating for Tsipras. Not only is the bank closure already hitting society and the economy, the cash machines could run out in days.</p>\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, things will take an even more dramatic turn for the worse on 20 July, when Athens is due to pay the ECB 3.5 billion euros. If Greece misses that payment, the central bank will probably conclude that the state is bust and, because of the way the country&rsquo;s banks are connected to the government, that they are insolvent too.</p>\r\n<p>A bust bank is a more serious matter than a bank holiday. People would be unable to use their credit cards or make electronic transfers. Tourists, who are currently unaffected by the capital controls, would no longer be able to extract cash. That would hardly be a good advertisement for Greece&rsquo;s most important industry. The economy would go into a tailspin.</p>\r\n<p>Before the banks could be reopened, they would need to be recapitalized. One way to do this would be for Greece to leave the euro. The government could then print drachmas and invest those in the banks. The other option would be to &lsquo;bail in&rsquo; depositors &ndash; taking a portion of their savings and converting them into capital.</p>\r\n<p>Since Tsipras has promised to do neither, he would be in a terrible bind. Indeed, it is possible that the strains on his government would become so great that it would fall. His majority is fairly slim, so there wouldn&rsquo;t need to be that many defectors before he lost a vote of confidence.</p>\r\n<p>That said, given the fat margin in the referendum, Tsipras looks secure for the moment. He might therefore be tempted to introduce a new currency, either to replace the euro or to run alongside it. Not only would this enable him to reopen the banks, it would also allow him to pay out salaries and pensions. The new currency would immediately fall to a big discount to the euro, perhaps half its value.</p>\r\n<p>Were Tsipras determined to do this, his euro zone creditors might be willing to discuss a &lsquo;velvet divorce&rsquo;. This would involve giving Greece some transitional aid to reduce the most severe humanitarian hardship while allowing the country to stay in the European Union.</p>\r\n<p>But the process of getting there will not be easy. Not only would it be a legal quagmire; it is not clear that the Greek people would let Tsipras bring back the drachma. The pro-European opposition would argue that he did not have a mandate to do so, as he has insisted that Sunday&rsquo;s referendum was not about the euro.</p>\r\n<p>Tsipras might also need a 60 percent majority in parliament, which he doesn&rsquo;t have, to change the country&rsquo;s currency, although the constitution isn&rsquo;t absolutely clear on this point. If he insisted on going ahead, it is also possible that the country&rsquo;s president would resign. In that scenario, there would probably have to be new elections &ndash; and, depending on what had happened in the intervening period, Tsipras might lose. If so, Greece might still hang on in the euro by its fingertips.</p>\r\n<p>If this all sounds like a lot of &lsquo;coulds&rsquo; and &lsquo;mights&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s because after the people&rsquo;s &lsquo;No&rsquo; vote, Greece is sailing in uncharted waters.

(242, 'Greece crisis: Tsipras looks like he is crumbling', '<p>It looks like Alexis Tsipras is crumbling.</p>\r\n<p>After the banks closed and public opinion started moving against him, the Greek prime minister seems desperate for a deal with his creditors. Athens has now defaulted to the International Monetary Fund, adding to the pressure. But it is not clear lenders will cut him any slack. They may prefer to deal with his successor.</p>\r\n<p>When Tsipras announced last week that Greece would hold a referendum on whether to accept a cash-for-reforms deal proposed by the euro zone and the International Monetary Fund, he said the proposals amounted to &lsquo;possibly the humiliation of an entire people&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p>The snag is that Tsipras did this when both the government and its banks were virtually out of cash. The European Central Bank refused to supply any more liquidity to banks. As a result, the banks were closed and on June 30 the government defaulted on a 1.5 billion euro payment due to the IMF.</p>\r\n<p>The immediate reaction of many Greeks to Tsipras&rsquo; referendum idea was to stand up to the creditors and vote &lsquo;No&rsquo;. But, since capital controls were imposed with cash withdrawals limited to 60 euros a day, opinion has started to swing towards &lsquo;Yes&rsquo;. The euro zone countries also made clear that voting &lsquo;No&rsquo; would amount to quitting the euro, something most Greeks do not want.</p>\r\n<p>Tsipras reacted by sending the euro zone bailout fund a new proposal on 30 June. This pleaded for an extension to the bailout programme, as well as a restructuring of Athens&rsquo; debt. The euro zone immediately rejected the plan. The Finnish finance minister pointed out that it was too late to extend a programme. Angela Merkel, Germany&rsquo;s chancellor, said there would be no new negotiations until after the 5 July referendum.</p>\r\n<p>The Greeks then said they would submit a second paper outlining reforms they plan to conduct. The euro zone finance ministers said they would hold another teleconference on 1 July to take stock of the situation, but that doesn&rsquo;t quite amount to reopening negotiations.</p>\r\n<p>All this seems a polite way of telling Tsipras: &lsquo;You are too late, buddy.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>One explanation for this line is that it takes time to negotiate a new agreement and then get parliamentary approval. The same old numbers cannot be used because Greece&rsquo;s economic prospects have deteriorated as a result of the past few days of capital controls.</p>\r\n<p>A solution could be to cancel the referendum, an idea floated by Greece&rsquo;s deputy prime minister. But the creditors are so fed up with Tsipras that they are unlikely to make his life easy. They expect any negotiations to be slippery and doubt Tsipras&rsquo; radical left Syriza party would implement anything he agreed to. By contrast, the creditors may hope that the Greeks will now vote &lsquo;Yes&rsquo;, Tsipras will resign and a more constructive prime minister will take over.</p>\r\n<p>Still, it would be wrong to think that a &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; vote would lead to a quick or straightforward solution, because of the complexities of Greek politics.</p>\r\n<p>One might think that opposition parties and Syriza could form a national salvation government. Something similar happened in 2011. But creditors would have little confidence that any government relying on Syriza would do what it promised. As a result, it would struggle to reach a new deal with its lenders and get the banks open.</p>\r\n<p>Knowing all this, the Greek political parties might conclude that it would be best to clear the air by calling new elections. But there&rsquo;s no guarantee that the opposition would win such a vote because it is fragmented. It has not yet managed to rally behind a single figure and a common programme.</p>\r\n<p>Even if the opposition won such an election, it would not be ready to start talks with its creditors until August. By then, the banks would have long run out of cash unless the ECB supplied more emergency liquidity, and the economy would be in a terrible state.</p>\r\n<p>Benoit Coeure, the ECB executive director responsible for negotiations with Athens, said this week that if Greeks vote &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; in the referendum, he had &lsquo;no doubt&rsquo; euro zone authorities would find ways to meet commitments towards the country. The snag is that it may struggle to find a legal route to provide more liquidity until a new agreement is reached.</p>\r\n<p>Hawks in the central bank are expected on 1 July to push for liquidity to be cut because of Athens&rsquo; default to the IMF, on the ground that the banks are heavily exposed to the government. But even if the ECB turns a blind eye to that, it can&rsquo;t ignore the 3.5 billion euros of loans due to be repaid to the ECB itself on 20 July.</p>\r\n<p>Hopefully, Coeure&rsquo;s reassuring prediction of how the euro zone will react if the Greeks vote &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; will prove correct. After all, even if the creditors are willing to let Tsipras hang out to dry, they shouldn&rsquo;t take the same approach to the Greek people.</p>', 31, 'Tsipras_crumbling.jpg', '', 'dsfsfsa', 1, '2015-08-11 14:00:09', 'published'),

Any cybersecurity law should define the crimes and punishments, determine an investigation authority with its power and jurisdiction, and identify the court to settle cases.</p>\r\n<p>The draft law has similarities with the Sri Lankan Computer Crime Act, 2007 and the draft Pakistani Electronic Documents and Computer Crimes Prevention Act, 2014 awaiting adoption by the Pakistani parliament. Similar to the Pakistani law, it talks about creating a cybersecurity authority to ensure the security of the computers, computer networks and curb cybercrimes (i.e., section 5). This agency will have the authority to monitor cybercrimes, financial transactions through computer networks, collect reports related to cybercrimes from the network operators, and impart cybersecurity training to the employees of different network service providers. While the Pakistani law specifically mentions a time limit for forming such an authority, the number of members, and the qualification of the members, our law is silent about these matters.</p>\r\n<p>The draft Bangladeshi cybersecurity law identifies computer fraud, identity theft and impersonation, cyberterrorism, violation of privacy, and production, distribution and watching pornography as crimes and recommends punishments for committing these crimes. Computer fraud is defined as unauthorised access to any computer or computer system or network with a view to harming the owner of the computer or the system or making financial gain by modifying, distorting or deleting any data. Spamming someone with an intention to harm him or her financially is also counted as a crime. Identity theft includes stealing one&rsquo;s identity to cheat or impersonate other people to make financial or material gain by using a computer or a computer system or network.</p>\r\n<p>Cyberterrorism occurs when the activities of the government or a government agency or an official is obstructed by terrorising people to jeopardize national security, sovereignty, solidarity and public order by using a computer or a computer network or by barring someone from accessing a computer, computer system or network. Unauthorised access to a computer, computer system or network, abetting and instigating someone to do so, and abusing someone&rsquo;s computer, computer system or network with a view to impeding public order and state security are also counted as cyberterrorist acts. Under the draft law, other cyberterrorist acts include spreading viruses to a computer system, jeopardizing the security of a foreign country, damaging the property of a foreign country, and obstructing an international organisation from doing its work by abusing computers, computer systems and networks.</p>\r\n<p>According to the draft law, one&rsquo;s privacy is violated by capturing a private picture of that person without his/her permission and disseminating such pictures. Private pictures refer to nude and half naked images of a person and images showing a person on underwear or briefs exposing their private parts. The law also criminalises the creation and distribution of pornography and accessing pornographic sites. The law recommends discreet punishments for all the above crimes.</p>\r\n<p>This draft law needs to be revamped because some of its provisions are obscure such as the provision for creating an investigation authority and some provisions such as the provision for search, seizure and arrest without warrant and the provision making the offences nonbailable raise eyebrows. It also needs to accommodate a few more issues. The law needs to further elaborate the section related to the investigation of the offenses (i.e., Section 17). This section can be strengthened by having options for creating an investigation team including computer hardware and software experts. Cybercrimes are specialised crimes which a police officer may not be able to handle. Both the Pakistani and Sri Lankan law have provisions to form investigation teams by incorporating technical experts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Bangladeshi draft law, similar to both the Pakistani and Sri Lankan law, gives an investigator authority to search any place, seize any computer or data, and arrest anyone without warrant if they have the reason to believe that a cybercrime is happening. Sometimes it may be necessary for the law enforcement agency to conduct a search and seizure and arrest someone without warrant but there is also a risk of misusing this provision. Similar to the Pakistani law, the draft law makes all the cybercrimes nonbailable. Bail, defined as some form of property deposited or pledged to the court to release an accused or a prisoner from the custody with a condition that he/she will show up in the court whenever required, has been treated as a fundamental right of the accused in Bangladeshi legal tradition. Bail is admitted to save an innocent from imprisonment. The court is believed to consider an accused innocent until he/she is proven guilty. However, there are some nonbailable offences according to the Bangladesh Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). For example, no bail is granted when the accused may be guilty of an offence punishable either by death or imprisonment for life. However, exception to this is also made if the accused is below sixteen years of age, a woman, or a sick person. Making all the cybercrimes nonbailable, the law takes the harshest route to resist the crimes and allows critics to say that a fundamental right has been taken away from the accused. So, as per our legal tradition, it would be wise not to make the offences nonbailable and leave the issue of bail to the discretion of the judges. Moreover, it is also harsh to treat the production and dissemination of pornography and accessing pornographic sites as crimes of the same magnitude. On the one hand, the law keeps provisions to punish people for violating other&rsquo;s privacy, but on the other hand, it creates opportunities for the cybersecurity authority to violate privacy through seamless monitoring of all computers, computer systems and networks.</p>\r\n<p>The law should accommodate provisions for creating cybersecurity response teams to deal with cybersecurity emergencies. Many countries such as the US, the UK, Pakistan, and India have such teams with legal mandates. It should also have provisions to adopt measures to develop mechanisms to make people aware of cybercrimes. Without public awareness and cooperation, no law or entity will be able to eliminate cybercrimes.</p>\r\n<p>I believe the law has been drafted in good faith to protect computers, computer systems and networks as well as users from being abused but it should not turn into a tool for violating privacy and human rights. &nbsp;</p>', 31, 'Human_Rights.jpg', '', 'scdscas', 1, '2015-08-11 14:00:55', 'published'),
(244, 'Yoga is a way of life, not just about postures', '<p>RSS spokesman-turned-BJP leader Ram Madhav''s audacious outburst against Vice President Hamid Ansari is a good example of what all can go wrong if politicians try to usurp the ancient science of yoga.</p>\r\n<p>Never mind that Ram Madhav ended up apologising for having publicly pulled up Ansari for not turning up at Rajpath on the occasion of the first International Day of Yoga. The fact that he even thought that Ansari ought to have done the yoga exercises is an insult to yogic principles.</p>\r\n<p>Yoga is not about physical exercises, nor should it be construed as a shortcut to better health. Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasises this repeatedly but it is clear many of his own supporters are not grasping it.</p>\r\n<p>The goal of yoga science is to primarily calm the mind. In his celebrated &lsquo;Autobiography of a Yogi&rsquo;, the iconic Paramhansa Yogananda wrote: &lsquo;Yoga is a method for restraining the natural turbulence of thoughts which otherwise impartially prevent all men, of all lands, from glimpsing their true nature of Spirit.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>Yogananda, India''s first yoga guru to spend over three decades in the US (until he passed away in 1952), learnt the hard way what yoga was all about under the watchful eyes of his strict guru, Swami Sri Yukteshwar.</p>\r\n<p>As a mosquito one day rudely attacked Yogananda''s thigh, the young monk automatically raised an avenging hand. And he suddenly remembered one of the basics of the yoga aphorisms -- of ''ahimsa'' or non-violence.</p>\r\n<p>Yukteshwar surprised Yogananda by remarking: &lsquo;Why don''t you finish the job?&rsquo; The student was perplexed. &lsquo;Master! Do you advocate taking life?&rsquo; No, was the reply, but hadn''t the deathblow been already struck in the mind? The guru explained that yoga opposed even the desire to kill.</p>\r\n<p>Such is the purity of the yoga system as outlined by Patanjali - the father figure of the ancient science. It covers 10 negative and positive moralities including avoiding injury to others, untruthfulness and stealing as well as maintaining self-discipline, purity of body and mind, and devotion to god. They also deal with ''asanas'' or postures, ''pranayama'' or breath control, concentration and meditation.</p>\r\n<p>What we saw at Rajpath was a fraction of yoga science: the ''asanas''.</p>\r\n<p>Yoga should indeed be promoted but it must never be forced on the unwilling. Doing so will itself be a violation of yoga science. None of our yoga gurus thrust the gems they held on anyone.</p>\r\n<p>When the followers of Lahiri Mahasaya, one of the greatest yoga masters India produced, sought his permission to expand the appeal of Kriya Yoga, he forbade it. &lsquo;Let the fragrance of the Kriya flower be wafted naturally, without any display.&rsquo; His disciplines included Muslims too but this was never a subject of debate. Lahiri Mahasaya passed away in Varanasi, now Modi''s Lok Sabha constituency.</p>\r\n<p>Even the ''asanas'' must be done under supervision -- because some yogic exercises can cause health issues to some people.</p>\r\n<p>Carl Gustav Jung, the Swiss psychologist who was an ardent admirer of yoga, said: &lsquo;Yoga practice is unthinkable, and would also be ineffectual, without the concepts on which yoga is based.&rsquo; It is a point emphasized by US-based David Frawley, whom the Modi government honoured with Padma Bhushan for his writings on Vedic studies.</p>\r\n<p>In his classic work on Tantric Yoga, Frawley explained that yoga was no joke. &lsquo;Unless we have controlled our sexual energy, unless our diet is pure yet nutritive, unless we have faith, equanimity and devotion, we do not have the foundation to undertake strong yogic practices like pranayama, mantra and meditation.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>All this does not mean that yogic ''asanas'' cannot be followed for good health. What it means is that yoga should not become a divisive issue, and it is best left to people to decide for themselves whether they want to embrace it or not.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>', 31, 'Modi-PERFORMING-yOGA.jpg', '', 'dfdsafafasgf', 1, '2015-08-11 14:14:18', 'published'),
(245, 'When cricket is catharsis', '<p>For Bangladesh, cricket is neither a religion, nor a source of big revenue. But the game is now followed more passionately than ever before by its countrymen, thanks to the good performance, increasingly frequent, of the national team, and a new-found consciousness of the present-day Bangladeshi cricket-lovers. This consciousness comes from their growing awareness of the game, and understanding of its economic, political and cultural dynamics.&nbsp;Cricket, to the Bangladeshis, now, is no longer only about cricket; it has become a multi-disciplinary space where they constantly associate ideas of national identity, political history and religion, all of which go far beyond the constraints of a cricket-stadium! Talking cricket is an instant source of solace, too, for the people of a country that is battling political violence and uncertainties for quite sometime now.</p>\r\n<p>Why does cricket have to bear the brunt of so many things in Bangladesh? This is surprising because, not so long ago, even in the early 90s, cricket was not the sport the countrymen followed passionately; football was. Local football teams would lock horns and thousands of football-crazy fans would flock to the stadiums, cheer their favourite teams and occasionally embroil in violence, too. But the football fans always knew that their national team was far away from competing at a global level.</p>\r\n<p>Cricket came to fill in this void. Although featured regularly in the Asia Cups in the 1980s, but it was the 1997 winning of the ICC Trophy that paved the way for Bangladesh to participate in the 1999 World Cup. This was the beginning of the change&mdash;not only a shift from football to cricket in the mind of the fans, but also the way the national cricket team has been viewed, now with high patriotic zeal and often with irrational expectations.&nbsp;Previously, Bangladeshi cricket-lovers were generally divided into India and Pakistan contingents in their support. But things changed decidedly for Bangladeshi fans post-1997, now that their own national team started to compete and challenge these established cricketing nations.</p>\r\n<p>There was an immediate success as the whole country went into a frenzy following their surprise win against Pakistan in the 1999 World Cup. From then on, any match against Pakistan has been branded as a mini-war, albeit on a cricket ground, somewhat modelled after Bangladesh&rsquo;s great Liberation War against Pakistan in 1971. Local media and now-a-days fans on social networking platforms never waste an opportunity to allude to the political past in order to tickle the nationalistic sentiments prior to any match against Pakistan.</p>\r\n<p>Things, however, were quite different back in the days of the 1980s and 90s when a huge majority of cricket fans in this Muslim-majority country used to support Pakistan owing to their common religious identity and perhaps erstwhile national identity (1947-1971). Back then, there were sizeable support for India in Bangladesh, too. There were many reasons: the West Bengal province of India shares the common linguistic and cultural heritage; Indian film-stars were (they still are) as big cultural icons in Bangladesh as they were in India; but the biggest reason perhaps was a sentiment that is political in nature&mdash;India was a supreme ally to Bangladesh in its glorious war of independence.</p>\r\n<p>India-Pakistan duels in Sharjah in the 1980s and 90s generated as much tension and jingoism in Bangladesh as they did in those countries. Support for India in Bangladesh, however, has waned considerably in recent years, which is interestingly coincided with India&rsquo;s rise in cricket and commerce in the last decade. The influence of the economic powerhouse, India, on Bangladesh&rsquo;s cricket is now clearly visible, but this influence has not translated into positive support for India from the Bangladeshi local fan-base. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The fact that India has never invited Bangladesh cricket team for a full-fledged tour despite being the closest neighbour is another reason that displeases the Bangladeshi fans. The new-generation Bangladeshi supporters now tend to look at any match with India as a potential David versus Goliath contest, and entertain the thought of beating India however unlikely that may be.&nbsp;The recent quarterfinal match between India and Bangladesh in the World Cup created such hype and intensity that Bangladeshi fans were literally outraged with their eventual loss&mdash;&lsquo;bloated&rsquo; the umpiring errors out of proportion, filled up the social networking sites and blogs with hate-posts and videos, and enthusiastically supported Australia in the semi-final in a bid to take revenge on their behalf! The current on-going home series against India has been touted as the &lsquo;pay-back&rsquo; time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Bangladesh&rsquo;s inconsistency in performance, too, is often harshly criticised by their supporters. They are also aware of the economic and bureaucratic constraints that plague cricket for years. Yet, the fans have immense confidence on the talent of the players, most of whom have battled the infrastructural deficiencies of the country on their own, and got noticed by being exceptionally gifted.</p>\r\n<p>For the fans, occasional wins against the top eight teams tend to offset the frustration of the heavy defeats that Bangladesh has suffered more frequently. Any win against a big team creates an occasion for a national celebration. In cricket, Bangladeshis are constantly looking for a space to get a relief from the daily failings that inflict their lives otherwise. The country is deeply immersed in persistent political crisis for years with the two mutually-loathing political parties that share the power by turns. Besides, cricket is the only sport where Bangladesh competes at an international level, and where the countrymen can support their national team. This support, often emotional and irrational, includes a constant search for national pride and self-respect. Perhaps that explains why the West Indies team bus was attacked by Bangladeshi fans following their heavy defeat in the 2011 World Cup, or, even the anti-India emotion following their defeat at the hands of India in this year&rsquo;s World Cup quarter final. Cricket, to Bangladeshi fans, has now become more than a game; a vicarious, transformational experience in which they go through a plethora of emotions that result in them some form of change or renewal&mdash;a catharsis. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>', 31, 'cricket_catharsis.jpg', '', 'vcxvxz', 1, '2015-08-11 14:22:56', 'published'),
(246, 'Modi''s challenges: Matching expectations with content', '<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi has started his second year with a reasonably positive track record. He, however, faces four clear challenges that he needs to urgently address if he aspires for a second term.</p>\r\n<p>First, the biggest challenge he faces is with regard to the aspirations and expectations of domestic constituencies, business and industry - and from the international community. This is unprecedented in terms of both scale and speed. UPA 2 had regrettably earned the tab of ''stand-still governance''. Both within India and abroad, there was clear frustration at the manner in which UPA-2 demonstrated utter disregard for India''s future.</p>\r\n<p>When Modi spoke of better days, it was hugely appealing to a population that had only seen the Indian economy slide for five years. In the biography of individuals, five years can be an interminably long period.</p>\r\n<p>Consequently, expectations in terms of what better days meant were considerable in terms of both scale and speed. Five years of inactivity had made people impatient. They needed to catch up on lost time. This was fast-forward aspiration. The demand was to cut red tape, create a forward looking budget and to put in place incentives that would spur economic activity and create jobs. But more importantly, the demand truly was to get all of this done overnight.</p>\r\n<p>As the past one year has demonstrated, this is a Herculean task and constitutes a significant challenge for the prime minister and his cabinet.</p>\r\n<p>If the second year of his governance does not show a positive turnaround, the Opposition and the international community would, most certainly, dub him as being high on intentions and low on delivery. He is confronted with a genuinely serious challenge.</p>\r\n<p>The second challenge is with regard to the bureaucracy and this is, to a considerable extent, a consequence of his personal style of functioning. Known to be a person who makes up his own mind, he has so far only succeeded in springing surprises on the bureaucracy and clearly leaving them out of the loop when he makes public announcements. While this might win him applause from crowds in Madison Garden and the Sydney Olympic Stadium that he appeared to revel in, it does not necessarily translate into approvals.</p>\r\n<p>The yardstick of good governance is verifiable translation of promises. Today, there appears to be - at least in terms of perceptions - a serious shortfall between promises and delivery.</p>\r\n<p>Consider, similarly, the strong manner in which the government has made its intentions clear with regard to zero-tolerance towards corruption. With the repeated allegations of corruption during the previous regime, this anti-corruption move has been largely welcomed. However, corruption cases, as we all know, are difficult to prove and where, indeed, traps have successfully ensnared officials and others, these are few and far to have any significant impact in curtailing prevalent levels of corruption. Focus on Swiss bank accounts, while important, ignores how deeply corruption has become an integral part of our everyday biography.</p>\r\n<p>The third challenge is from his cabinet and party colleagues. At one level, clearly irresponsible statements by many of his party members have been a cause of serious concern because of the manner in which they have been perceived as imposing a Hindutva agenda and challenging the secular fabric of India. The prime minister has chosen to keep silent on every occasion and opted for an alternative course where he has, through his own public statements and personal meetings, sought to assuage fears among minority communities. While this is good, it is not good enough because it does not unambiguously demonstrate clarity on how the prime minister himself thinks.</p>\r\n<p>More serious is the manner in which chest-thumping took place after the Special Forces'' action in Myanmar, especially because words of bravado and public boasting, including threats to neighbouring countries, were made by those who were clearly not directly in the know of the things. The army, the NSA and the Prime Minister''s Office did precisely what they needed to do: they did not comment or issue long-winded statements. Every country that has carried out such operations issues a bland statement: ''An operation was carried out successfully by the Special Forces, which suffered no casualties.'' The media and others are then left to draw their own conclusions. Bizarrely, however, this became a media circus with wild statements and hypothetical threats. Modi needs to recognize that his cabinet colleagues lack maturity and understanding. Unless he is able to curb their enthusiasm for making press statements, his own credibility is likely to be seriously undermined.</p>\r\n<p>Modi has given sufficient evidence to demonstrate that he possesses all the tools to be a master tactician and strategist. But as Capablanca, the great chess genius advised, ''Play chess backwards; start from the endgame.'' Strategies and tactics or ''the how'' works only when you first have clarity on ''the why'' and ''the what''.</p>\r\n<p>After a year of governance, sadly, the prime minister appears to have been so fascinated by his own style that he has mistaken it for content. This is his fourth challenge and one which is self-imposed.</p>\r\n<p><em>***Amit Dasgupta, a former diplomat, heads the recently launched Mumbai campus of the SP Jain School of Global Management.

(247, 'Beyond the Box: Modi-fied Indo-Bangla relationship', '<p>During his two day visit to Bangladesh, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi mesmerised us with his fiery populist rhetoric. The message which he tried to convey loud and clear is that &lsquo;we want to take Bangladesh as a partner and want to prosper together&rsquo;. What does it mean for Bangladesh? Can Bangladesh keep faith in Modi?</p>\r\n<p>Surrounded by India on three sides, Bangladesh has many unsettled issues with India, such as, land boundary disputes, border killings, sharing of water flowing through the common rivers, and trade deficit. The relationship between these two neighbours went through many ups and downs during the last 44 years because of India&rsquo;s &lsquo;big-brother&rsquo; attitude toward Bangladesh&rsquo;s legitimate concerns and the rise of anti-Indian political parties in Bangladesh.</p>\r\n<p>In recent years the global political economy has changed significantly. In the globalising world both opportunities and risks are shared.&nbsp; Interconnectedness and regional and sub-regional constellations of states have emerged in different parts of the world to avail the opportunities and countervailing the risks. Since both Bangladesh and India are developing countries with potential and aspirations to spearhead economic growth, the supreme leaderships in these countries have realised the importance of collaboration instead of conflict in climbing the upper echelon of economic development.</p>\r\n<p>Alongside the need of economic prosperity, the common threat of religious extremism helped them come together. The Sheikh Hasina government in Bangladesh rendered whole-hearted support to India while the Modi government in India has reciprocated that. Modi made his intention to collaborate with neighbours crystal clear by inviting the heads of neighbouring states to his oath taking ceremony. He has adopted a &lsquo;Look East&rsquo; policy. He wants to escalate cooperation with eastern countries including China instead of depending on the West. Modi has envisaged plans to make India a leading power and realised that it is impossible without the help of the neighbours.</p>\r\n<p>As the next door neighbour, India needs support from Bangladesh to maintain security and national integrity, transit and transhipment through Bangladesh to reach goods and services to its north eastern region at a low cost, and to secure a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. On the other hand, Bangladesh needs to bury tension at the border with India, eliminate trade deficit, and get transit and transhipment facilities through India to connect with Nepal, Bhutan, and China. Moreover, Bangladesh can also be benefitted by working closely with a rising economic superpower like India. Modi has unequivocally mentioned in his statements that India and Bangladesh can prosper together and highlighted that he and Sheikh Hasina are on the same page because they both are concerned about national development.</p>\r\n<p>During Modi&rsquo;s visit to Bangladesh, the two countries signed 22 agreements, protocols and memorandum of understandings (MoU) for bilateral cooperation in different sectors. The major ones include agreements on connectivity through land, railways and sea, understanding on setting up power plants in Bangladesh by two Indian companies to generate 4,600 megawatt of electricity, creating special economic zones in Mongla and Bheramara for Indian companies, permitting India to use Mongla and Chittagong port, and the announcement of a $2 billion line of credit for Bangladesh from India.</p>\r\n<p>The connectivity agreement was materialised immediately by initiating bus services from Kolkata to Shillong via Dhaka and Kolkata to Siliguri via Dhaka. India will also be able to use Bangladesh&rsquo;s waterways and railways to reach out to its North Eastern States such as Assam and Tripura. Bangladesh has approved a draft Motor Vehicle Agreement at the cabinet to facilitate vehicle movements among Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal. If the agreement is signed, Bangladesh will have an opportunity to become a hub of regional connectivity and will be able to reach out to Nepal, Bhutan and China. Bangladesh has to determine fees for transit and transhipment according to international standards to gain from this connectivity move.</p>\r\n<p>The proposed power plants will contribute to reduce the scarcity of power in Bangladesh. Uninterrupted power supply is essential for economic progress. The offer for establishing special economic zones by India in Bangladesh will attract Indian investment. In the contemporary capitalist global economy, attracting foreign investment is a key to generate jobs and reduce trade deficit. Further revenues can accrue to Bangladesh&rsquo;s coffer by allowing India to use Chittagong and Mongla port on a pay-per basis.</p>\r\n<p>But we have to take the offer of $2 billion line of credit from India with a pinch of salt because usually country to country loans come with a lot of strings. The lending country wants to recoup as much money as possible by dictating the spending of the money. Bangladesh has to bargain hard to better utilise this credit by minimising the strings.</p>\r\n<p>The exclusion of Teesta water sharing issue from the official agenda set a melancholic tone in Bangladeshi public discourse. The lack of water flow from the Indian part of the Teesta to Bangladesh has been causing desertification in the northern part of Bangladesh. Modi seemed to realise the sentiment and assured that there would be solution to this problem in the near future. He needs West Bengal&rsquo;s cooperation in this regard because the management of Teesta water is in the purview of the West Bengal government. He sought some time to resolve this issue in consultation with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. While he was in his return flight to Delhi, Modi created a committee comprising members from the central government and West Bengal government to figure out a plausible Teesta deal.</p>\r\n<p>As a realist, I would like to keep faith in Modi for a Teesta deal. It was his charisma and leadership that had the both houses of the Indian parliament unanimously ratified the Mujib-Indira Land Boundary Agreement after 41 years. During his visit to Bangladesh, officials representing the two governments exchanged documents to implement the agreement. The implementation process will start on 31 July with the exchange of enclaves.</p>\r\n<p>Bangladesh&rsquo;s gain from the agreements, protocols and MoUs will depend on its officials&rsquo; negotiation skills and thorough knowledge and preparation about the issues. However, the best achievement for both countries from Modi&rsquo;s visit is that they gained each other&rsquo;s trust to develop an enduring partnership to move along the path of prosperity. Time will say what this partnership will yield. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>', 30, 'India-Bangladesh.jpg', '', 'fserfsgfar', 1, '2015-08-11 13:53:49', 'published');

But it has no realistic solution for India&rsquo;s energy or food security needs. Depending on imported oil or renewables like solar energy is not an option. Nor is organic farming.</p>\r\n<p>Instead of calling Greenpeace&rsquo;s bluff with arguments, high handedness has allowed the NGO to style itself as the victim of the government&rsquo;s intolerance to dissent.</p>\r\n<p>Further embellishment has been provided by the government&rsquo;s malicious action against the Ford Foundation, which has been a force for good and is fondly remembered for its role in the Green Revolution.</p>\r\n<p>Under Chowdhury&rsquo;s stewardship, the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI) allowed cultivation of Bt brinjal in October 2013, after doing its own agronomic studies, but relying on Indian bio-safety data.</p>\r\n<p>In the first season, 20 farmers were given the seeds. They reported 70-90 per cent reduction in pesticide sprays, 30 percent increase in marketable yield and a net benefit of around $650 per bigha (one-third of an acre).</p>\r\n<p>The brinjals were marketed as pesticide free and fetched a premium. Currently, 108 farmers there have been permitted to grow Bt brinjal, whose seeds farmers can re-use.</p>\r\n<p>India&rsquo;s Mahyco-Monsanto has offered the Bt technology gratis to BARI for use in open pollinating varieties. The company reserves the right to sell Bt hybrids in that country.</p>\r\n<p>It had a similar arrangement with the University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad, Tamil Nadu Agriculture University and the Indian Institute of Vegetable Research, Varanasi, under the Agricultural Biotechnology Support Programme II run out of Cornell University.</p>\r\n<p>Then Indian environment minister Jairam Ramesh, for reasons that can be speculated, overruled the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), India&rsquo;s regulator for GM crop, and announced an indefinite moratorium. This February marked the fifth anniversary of the ban.</p>\r\n<p>Civil society groups in Bangladesh have not reconciled themselves to Bt brinjal and have been quite uncivil in their protests. Mark Lynas, an opponent of GM technology-turned-advocate, wrote earlier this month that his meeting with Mohammed Rahman, a farmer growing Bt brinjal at Krishnapur, about 100km from Dhaka, happened under the overhang of violence.</p>\r\n<p>The meeting was arranged by BARI. The press coverage of Bt brinjal in the Bangladesh press has been incendiary, he wrote in the New York Times. Activists have been pressuring farmers into uprooting their crop, he said.</p>\r\n<p>Chowdhury&rsquo;s forthrightness is in contrast to official Indian timidity. The government policy is to allow GM crops after full scientific evaluation of their bio-safety, impact on environment and on consumers, Sanjeev Kumar Balyan, Minister of State for Agriculture and Food Processing Industries, had told the Lok Sabha last July. The government follows a policy of &lsquo;case by case&rsquo; approvals for GM crops, he said.</p>\r\n<p>In the same month, Minister for Environment and Forests Prakash Javadekar in a written reply in the Lok Sabha said that there &lsquo;is no proposal for a complete ban&rsquo; on release of GM organisms either for commercial cultivation or for experiments.</p>\r\n<p>In November, Javadekar told the Lok Sabha that the central government had filed its objections in the Supreme Court against the ban on GM crop trials recommended by five of six members of the Technical Expert Committee which the apex court had set up in May 2012 to examine the strength of India&rsquo;s regulatory mechanism.</p>\r\n<p>The government is of the view that &lsquo;research in GM and confined field trials for generating bio-safety data with all due precautions should be allowed to continue in the national interest,&rsquo; Javadekar stated.</p>\r\n<p>Currently, four states have allowed trials of GM crops in India.

This despite the fact that more than a trillion meals containing genetically modified food have already been eaten in the United States without incident. Science has decisively found that these foods have no negative impact on health.</p>\r\n<p>Chipotle&rsquo;s move seems to be based more on marketing than on science.</p>\r\n<p>Recent research drives home how misled alarmists are about genetically modified food. All human beings, two Cambridge University scientists have established, are genetically modified, including Chipotle&rsquo;s customers. Over the years, hundreds of foreign genes have jumped into human DNA through a natural phenomenon called &ldquo;gene flow.&rdquo; As a result, all humans carry genes that originated in algae, bacteria and fungi.</p>\r\n<p>If humans can safely accept alien genes without mishap, why not food, too?</p>\r\n<p>Farmers and breeders have for centuries used cross-breeding to improve the genetic characteristics of crops and animals. Because this process involves gene transfers within the same species, environmental advocates label it &ldquo;natural&rdquo; &mdash; even though cross-breeding is clearly man-made. Modern genetic splicing makes it possible to combine genes from completely different species to produce much-needed products, including pest-resistant and high-yielding crops.</p>\r\n<p>The Bt gene from pest-resistant bacteria, for example, has been inserted into cotton to create a pest-resistant Bt cotton. The combination has greatly raised yields and reduced pesticide use. But some activists condemn this as a crime against nature.</p>\r\n<p>When fears about genetically modified foods first arose, little was known about gene flow, also called horizontal gene transfer. The idea that genes could jump across species violated then-conventional wisdom. But scientific research has established that natural gene transfers regularly occur. So genetic transfers are not a human invention &mdash; just a belated human effort to imitate what nature has been doing all along.</p>\r\n<p>This discovery has convinced some longtime campaigners against genetically modified crops to make a U-turn. British author and journalist Mark Lynas, for example, converted from being an activist opposed to genetically modified food to a firm supporter in a notable 2013 mea culpa speech, in which he apologized for letting his opinions trump the scientific data.</p>\r\n<p>Scientists once thought that gene transfers occurred naturally only in simple organisms like bacteria. But research shows that transfers are also common in complex species, including human beings. Does this genetic intrusion make humans a monster species? Hardly.</p>\r\n<p>The Economist used the headline &ldquo;Genetically Modified People&rdquo; for a report on genetic research by Alastair Crisp and Chiara Boschetti, the two Cambridge scientists. They have identified 145 genes that have crossed over from other species to humans.</p>\r\n<p>This is, of course, a tiny fraction of the 20,000 odd genes in a human body. Why then should environmentalists lose sleep over the introduction of a single alien gene into crops?</p>\r\n<p>Research on gene flow is still in its infancy. It could ultimately reveal thousands of alien genes that have entered human DNA. This should be no surprise: Nature has had almost a million years to do its work.</p>\r\n<p>One gene identified by the Cambridge researchers helps hold cells together; it crossed over into humans from a fungus. Marine algae appear to be the source of another human gene associated with fat mass. Bacteria have provided a third gene that helps define blood groups.</p>\r\n<p>Apart from human transfers, the scientists examined gene transfers in nine other primate species, 12 fruit fly species and four nematode worms. They found that the phenomenon was ubiquitous. The researchers considered the possibility that what looked like gene transfers between species might actually be genes both had inherited from a common ancestor millions of years ago.</p>\r\n<p>Genes found in another animal could be a common ancient inheritance. But genes in animals that came from plants or bacteria would almost certainly represent gene flow. Crisp and Boschetti found that, on average, worms had 173 gene transfers, fruit flies 40, and primates had 109. Humans, with 145 transfers, were more genetically modified than other primates.</p>\r\n<p>The researchers found two imported genes for amino-acid metabolism, 13 for fat metabolism and 15 for modifying large molecules. They identified five immigrant genes that generated valuable anti-oxidants, and seven that aided the immune system.</p>\r\n<p>Far from creating monsters, the scientists found that genes from alien species appear beneficial. Activists against genetically modified organisms can argue that natural gene transfers have been spaced out over millennia, giving species time to adapt. But every time a natural gene transfer occurred, it carried the same risks as the insertion of a Bt gene into cotton or eggplants.</p>\r\n<p>Besides, all crops, genetically modified or otherwise, are field-tested for safety before commercial release. The United States has approved dozens of genetically modified crops for commercial use. Virtually all U.S. corn and soybeans today are genetically modified.</p>\r\n<p>Chipotle&rsquo;s claim of serving food free of genetic modifications is dubious because the meats it serves come from animals and chickens likely fed on genetically modified corn and soybean meal. More important, why should Chipotle even make the claim when its own customers are genetically modified?</p>', 30, 'If.jpg', '', 'xszxZS', 1, '2015-08-11 13:51:35', 'published'),
(251, 'A plan for closing Guantanamo', '<p>When President Barack Obama announced his intention to close the Guantanamo Bay detention center on his second day in office, he sounded serious.</p>\r\n<p>He was flanked by more than a dozen retired military leaders, who&rsquo;d all urged him to close the facility because it had become a virtual recruitment tool for terrorists and a stain on the United States&rsquo; reputation for upholding human rights and the rule of law. Obama also had the support of national-security experts across the political spectrum when he signed his historic executive order.</p>\r\n<p>More than six years later, the U.S. facility in Cuba is still open. The primary reason is that ever since the president made it a priority to close Guantanamo, congressional Republicans made it a priority to keep it open. They&rsquo;ve even stepped up their efforts while writing the annual defense authorization bill this year.</p>\r\n<p>Leg shackles are seen on the floor at Camp 6 detention center, at the U.S. Naval Base, in Guantanamo Bay</p>\r\n<p>Obama has again threatened to veto the bill over these obstructionist tactics. But unlike previous years, if he&rsquo;s going to keep a key promise he made when he entered the White House &mdash; one he said &ldquo;would further the national security and foreign-policy interests of the United States and the interests of justice&rdquo; &mdash; he has to follow through.</p>\r\n<p>Over the years, Congress has passed a series of onerous restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees to other countries, and since 2010, a complete ban on bringing any to the United States, even for trial. This even though such prominent Republican leaders as Senators John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) have, in the past, supported closing the facility for national-security reasons. And even though the U.S. federal courts&rsquo; record for prosecuting terrorists is far stronger than the record of the fledgling Guantanamo military commissions. Federal courts have prosecuted more than 500 people on terrorism charges in the 13 years since the Sept. 11 attacks; the commissions haven&rsquo;t yet managed to bring the five accused plotters of the attacks to trial.</p>\r\n<p>Now, facing the second half of Obama&rsquo;s second term, Congress has gone even further: The House and Senate Armed Services Committees have proposed such draconian restrictions on transferring the detainees that, if enacted, Obama would never be able to close the prison.</p>\r\n<p>The House version, for example, would not only prevent detainee transfers to the United States, but it would also ban transfers to any place the Internal Revenue Service labels a &ldquo;combat zone,&rdquo; a term not based on danger level but devised for purposes of giving servicemembers a tax break. These are locations, established by executive order, where &ldquo;the U.S. Armed Forces are engaging or have engaged in combat.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a wide swath of territory. &ldquo;Combat zones&rdquo; include such places as Albania and Bosnia-Herzegovina &mdash; U.S. allies where the United States hasn&rsquo;t been engaged in active hostilities for more than a decade and that have already safely resettled more than a dozen Guantanamo detainees.</p>\r\n<p>File photo of detainees sitting at Naval Base Guantanamo Bay</p>\r\n<p>The president shouldn&rsquo;t stand for that. As commander in chief, he&rsquo;s responsible for protecting the nation and carrying out an effective foreign policy. He and many others have made clear that closing Guantanamo is critical to these goals. He should veto any legislation that comes out of Congress that would thwart them.</p>\r\n<p>Although the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday passed a bill that McCain said would provide a path for closing Guantanamo, it does not lift transfer restrictions. It requires instead that the Obama administration first propose a plan for closing the facility for Congress to accept or reject. Yet, given its stance over the past six years, and the recent House bill, there is no reason to believe Congress would approve any plan Obama put forward.</p>\r\n<p>No president likes vetoing an authorizations bill, of course, because that&rsquo;s how important agency and department budgets get set. But it would hardly be unprecedented. President George W. Bush vetoed the defense authorization act in 2008 on the grounds that it would imperil the economic security and reconstruction of Iraq, a major goal of his presidency. President Bill Clinton vetoed the bill in 1996 because, among other things, it would have restricted the president&rsquo;s ability to conduct contingency operations. Obama has repeatedly threatened to veto the act, but each time Congress agreed to minor legislative changes. And he signed it.</p>\r\n<p>This time, the president needs more than minimal tinkering to address a law that would block a cornerstone of his national security policy. Unless Congress agrees to withdraw the restrictions entirely and work with the president to finally shutter the Guantanamo detention center, the president should follow through with a veto.</p>\r\n<p>What makes this time different?</p>\r\n<p>Congress has grown ever bolder in its efforts to defy the president in what its critics say is a concerted effort to undermine Obama&rsquo;s and his party&rsquo;s legacy, which some Republicans insist is a radical left-wing agenda that will &ldquo;endanger America.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Though there&rsquo;s no way to take politics out of governance, it&rsquo;s gotten to the point where that defiance is interfering with Obama&rsquo;s ability, as commander in chief, to protect the nation.</p>\r\n<p>Obama has shown he is willing to make bold moves when it comes to issues he cares about, including immigration and raising the minimum wage. The president doesn&rsquo;t have much time left when it comes to one of his key national security initiatives &mdash; closing Guantanamo.</p>\r\n<p>He should wait no longer.&nbsp; Now is the time.</p>', 30, 'closing_Guantanamo.jpg', '', 'zaZasas', 1, '2015-08-11 13:50:47', 'published'),

But it has no realistic solution for India&rsquo;s energy or food security needs. Depending on imported oil or renewables like solar energy is not an option. Nor is organic farming.</p>\r\n<p>Instead of calling Greenpeace&rsquo;s bluff with arguments, high handedness has allowed the NGO to style itself as the victim of the government&rsquo;s intolerance to dissent.</p>\r\n<p>Further embellishment has been provided by the government&rsquo;s malicious action against the Ford Foundation, which has been a force for good and is fondly remembered for its role in the Green Revolution.</p>\r\n<p>Under Chowdhury&rsquo;s stewardship, the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI) allowed cultivation of Bt brinjal in October 2013, after doing its own agronomic studies, but relying on Indian bio-safety data.</p>\r\n<p>In the first season, 20 farmers were given the seeds. They reported 70-90 per cent reduction in pesticide sprays, 30 percent increase in marketable yield and a net benefit of around $650 per bigha (one-third of an acre).</p>\r\n<p>The brinjals were marketed as pesticide free and fetched a premium. Currently, 108 farmers there have been permitted to grow Bt brinjal, whose seeds farmers can re-use.</p>\r\n<p>India&rsquo;s Mahyco-Monsanto has offered the Bt technology gratis to BARI for use in open pollinating varieties. The company reserves the right to sell Bt hybrids in that country.</p>\r\n<p>It had a similar arrangement with the University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad, Tamil Nadu Agriculture University and the Indian Institute of Vegetable Research, Varanasi, under the Agricultural Biotechnology Support Programme II run out of Cornell University.</p>\r\n<p>Then Indian environment minister Jairam Ramesh, for reasons that can be speculated, overruled the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), India&rsquo;s regulator for GM crop, and announced an indefinite moratorium. This February marked the fifth anniversary of the ban.</p>\r\n<p>Civil society groups in Bangladesh have not reconciled themselves to Bt brinjal and have been quite uncivil in their protests.

The press coverage of Bt brinjal in the Bangladesh press has been incendiary, he wrote in the New York Times. Activists have been pressuring farmers into uprooting their crop, he said.</p>\r\n<p>Chowdhury&rsquo;s forthrightness is in contrast to official Indian timidity. The government policy is to allow GM crops after full scientific evaluation of their bio-safety, impact on environment and on consumers, Sanjeev Kumar Balyan, Minister of State for Agriculture and Food Processing Industries, had told the Lok Sabha last July. The government follows a policy of &lsquo;case by case&rsquo; approvals for GM crops, he said.</p>\r\n<p>In the same month, Minister for Environment and Forests Prakash Javadekar in a written reply in the Lok Sabha said that there &lsquo;is no proposal for a complete ban&rsquo; on release of GM organisms either for commercial cultivation or for experiments.</p>\r\n<p>In November, Javadekar told the Lok Sabha that the central government had filed its objections in the Supreme Court against the ban on GM crop trials recommended by five of six members of the Technical Expert Committee which the apex court had set up in May 2012 to examine the strength of India&rsquo;s regulatory mechanism.</p>\r\n<p>The government is of the view that &lsquo;research in GM and confined field trials for generating bio-safety data with all due precautions should be allowed to continue in the national interest,&rsquo; Javadekar stated.</p>\r\n<p>Currently, four states have allowed trials of GM crops in India. But what after that? Will the central government allow their commercial cultivation? So far only Bt cotton has been approved. That was 13 years ago.</p>\r\n<p>The anti-GM activists have no case.

British author and journalist Mark Lynas, for example, converted from being an activist opposed to genetically modified food to a firm supporter in a notable 2013 mea culpa speech, in which he apologized for letting his opinions trump the scientific data.</p>\r\n<p>Scientists once thought that gene transfers occurred naturally only in simple organisms like bacteria. But research shows that transfers are also common in complex species, including human beings. Does this genetic intrusion make humans a monster species? Hardly.</p>\r\n<p>The Economist used the headline &ldquo;Genetically Modified People&rdquo; for a report on genetic research by Alastair Crisp and Chiara Boschetti, the two Cambridge scientists. They have identified 145 genes that have crossed over from other species to humans.</p>\r\n<p>This is, of course, a tiny fraction of the 20,000 odd genes in a human body. Why then should environmentalists lose sleep over the introduction of a single alien gene into crops?</p>\r\n<p>Research on gene flow is still in its infancy. It could ultimately reveal thousands of alien genes that have entered human DNA. This should be no surprise: Nature has had almost a million years to do its work.</p>\r\n<p>One gene identified by the Cambridge researchers helps hold cells together; it crossed over into humans from a fungus. Marine algae appear to be the source of another human gene associated with fat mass. Bacteria have provided a third gene that helps define blood groups.</p>\r\n<p>Apart from human transfers, the scientists examined gene transfers in nine other primate species, 12 fruit fly species and four nematode worms. They found that the phenomenon was ubiquitous. The researchers considered the possibility that what looked like gene transfers between species might actually be genes both had inherited from a common ancestor millions of years ago.</p>\r\n<p>Genes found in another animal could be a common ancient inheritance. But genes in animals that came from plants or bacteria would almost certainly represent gene flow. Crisp and Boschetti found that, on average, worms had 173 gene transfers, fruit flies 40, and primates had 109. Humans, with 145 transfers, were more genetically modified than other primates.</p>\r\n<p>The researchers found two imported genes for amino-acid metabolism, 13 for fat metabolism and 15 for modifying large molecules. They identified five immigrant genes that generated valuable anti-oxidants, and seven that aided the immune system.</p>\r\n<p>Far from creating monsters, the scientists found that genes from alien species appear beneficial. Activists against genetically modified organisms can argue that natural gene transfers have been spaced out over millennia, giving species time to adapt. But every time a natural gene transfer occurred, it carried the same risks as the insertion of a Bt gene into cotton or eggplants.</p>\r\n<p>Besides, all crops, genetically modified or otherwise, are field-tested for safety before commercial release. The United States has approved dozens of genetically modified crops for commercial use. Virtually all U.S. corn and soybeans today are genetically modified.</p>\r\n<p>Chipotle&rsquo;s claim of serving food free of genetic modifications is dubious because the meats it serves come from animals and chickens likely fed on genetically modified corn and soybean meal. More important, why should Chipotle even make the claim when its own customers are genetically modified?</p>', 31, 'want_naturet.jpg', '', 'ZZ', 1, '2015-08-11 14:18:51', 'published');

(255, 'A plan for closing Guantanamo', '<p>When President Barack Obama announced his intention to close the Guantanamo Bay detention center on his second day in office, he sounded serious.</p>\r\n<p>He was flanked by more than a dozen retired military leaders, who&rsquo;d all urged him to close the facility because it had become a virtual recruitment tool for terrorists and a stain on the United States&rsquo; reputation for upholding human rights and the rule of law. Obama also had the support of national-security experts across the political spectrum when he signed his historic executive order.</p>\r\n<p>More than six years later, the U.S. facility in Cuba is still open. The primary reason is that ever since the president made it a priority to close Guantanamo, congressional Republicans made it a priority to keep it open. They&rsquo;ve even stepped up their efforts while writing the annual defense authorization bill this year.</p>\r\n<p>Leg shackles are seen on the floor at Camp 6 detention center, at the U.S. Naval Base, in Guantanamo Bay</p>\r\n<p>Obama has again threatened to veto the bill over these obstructionist tactics. But unlike previous years, if he&rsquo;s going to keep a key promise he made when he entered the White House &mdash; one he said &ldquo;would further the national security and foreign-policy interests of the United States and the interests of justice&rdquo; &mdash; he has to follow through.</p>\r\n<p>Over the years, Congress has passed a series of onerous restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees to other countries, and since 2010, a complete ban on bringing any to the United States, even for trial. This even though such prominent Republican leaders as Senators John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) have, in the past, supported closing the facility for national-security reasons. And even though the U.S. federal courts&rsquo; record for prosecuting terrorists is far stronger than the record of the fledgling Guantanamo military commissions. Federal courts have prosecuted more than 500 people on terrorism charges in the 13 years since the Sept. 11 attacks; the commissions haven&rsquo;t yet managed to bring the five accused plotters of the attacks to trial.</p>\r\n<p>Now, facing the second half of Obama&rsquo;s second term, Congress has gone even further: The House and Senate Armed Services Committees have proposed such draconian restrictions on transferring the detainees that, if enacted, Obama would never be able to close the prison.</p>\r\n<p>The House version, for example, would not only prevent detainee transfers to the United States, but it would also ban transfers to any place the Internal Revenue Service labels a &ldquo;combat zone,&rdquo; a term not based on danger level but devised for purposes of giving servicemembers a tax break. These are locations, established by executive order, where &ldquo;the U.S. Armed Forces are engaging or have engaged in combat.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a wide swath of territory. &ldquo;Combat zones&rdquo; include such places as Albania and Bosnia-Herzegovina &mdash; U.S. allies where the United States hasn&rsquo;t been engaged in active hostilities for more than a decade and that have already safely resettled more than a dozen Guantanamo detainees.</p>\r\n<p>File photo of detainees sitting at Naval Base Guantanamo Bay</p>\r\n<p>The president shouldn&rsquo;t stand for that. As commander in chief, he&rsquo;s responsible for protecting the nation and carrying out an effective foreign policy. He and many others have made clear that closing Guantanamo is critical to these goals. He should veto any legislation that comes out of Congress that would thwart them.</p>\r\n<p>Although the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday passed a bill that McCain said would provide a path for closing Guantanamo, it does not lift transfer restrictions. It requires instead that the Obama administration first propose a plan for closing the facility for Congress to accept or reject. Yet, given its stance over the past six years, and the recent House bill, there is no reason to believe Congress would approve any plan Obama put forward.</p>\r\n<p>No president likes vetoing an authorizations bill, of course, because that&rsquo;s how important agency and department budgets get set. But it would hardly be unprecedented. President George W. Bush vetoed the defense authorization act in 2008 on the grounds that it would imperil the economic security and reconstruction of Iraq, a major goal of his presidency. President Bill Clinton vetoed the bill in 1996 because, among other things, it would have restricted the president&rsquo;s ability to conduct contingency operations. Obama has repeatedly threatened to veto the act, but each time Congress agreed to minor legislative changes. And he signed it.</p>\r\n<p>This time, the president needs more than minimal tinkering to address a law that would block a cornerstone of his national security policy. Unless Congress agrees to withdraw the restrictions entirely and work with the president to finally shutter the Guantanamo detention center, the president should follow through with a veto.</p>\r\n<p>What makes this time different?</p>\r\n<p>Congress has grown ever bolder in its efforts to defy the president in what its critics say is a concerted effort to undermine Obama&rsquo;s and his party&rsquo;s legacy, which some Republicans insist is a radical left-wing agenda that will &ldquo;endanger America.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Though there&rsquo;s no way to take politics out of governance, it&rsquo;s gotten to the point where that defiance is interfering with Obama&rsquo;s ability, as commander in chief, to protect the nation.</p>\r\n<p>Obama has shown he is willing to make bold moves when it comes to issues he cares about, including immigration and raising the minimum wage. The president doesn&rsquo;t have much time left when it comes to one of his key national security initiatives &mdash; closing Guantanamo.</p>\r\n<p>He should wait no longer.&nbsp; Now is the time.</p>', 31, 'plan_closing_Guantanamo.jpg', '', 'xczczc', 1, '2015-08-11 14:20:08', 'published'),
(256, 'Iran Nuclear Deal: We are very confident: Susan Rice', '<p>Washington: Reuters White House Correspondent Jeff Mason interviewed Susan Rice, National Security Adviser to President Barack Obama, on Wednesday on the Iran nuclear deal. Here is a full transcript of the interview.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Q. Ambassador Rice, thank you very much for joining us today.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A. Good to be with you, Jeff.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Q. I&rsquo;d like to start by just getting straight into the weeds of this deal. It gives Iran 24 days before it has to grant access to suspicious sites. Does this include all military sites? And is granting access an obligation to Iran if the committee decides that? Or is it simply a request as some people have interpreted?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A. Well, let me give you the whole context. In the first instance, recall that all of Iran&rsquo;s known nuclear facilities will be under 24-7 monitoring, continuous monitoring, by the IAEA, so that&rsquo;s the first point. Secondly, the IAEA and international inspectors will have continuous access to the entire supply chain of Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program &mdash; so its uranium mines, its mills, its manufacturing facilities, its centrifuge manufacturing facilities, as well as any facilities that are actually spinning centrifuges. So the whole supply chain has continuous monitoring.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So what we&rsquo;re talking about and what you&rsquo;re asking in your question is, if we have information about a non-declared suspicious site, what is the process for investigating that site. So let me explain it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In the first instance, let&rsquo;s say that the United States, for example, gathers some information that we believe indicates that there is a suspicious or secret site. We would take that information to the IAEA. The IAEA would investigate. The IAEA would go to Iran and say, &lsquo;We want to visit this site. We want to check it out.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>And by checking it out, it&rsquo;s not just visiting, it&rsquo;s doing environmental sampling, soil sampling, radioactive materials would be tested for and if they are detected. If the Iranians said, &lsquo;No, you can&rsquo;t see that site,&rsquo; whether it&rsquo;s a military site or not, the IAEA, if it deems the site suspicious, can ask for access to it. So there are no limitations on the type of facility that can be accessed but there has to be a reasonable suspicion.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So, if Iran says no, what happens is, there is a process that has to conclude finally within 24 days, during which time if Iran and the IAEA can&rsquo;t agree on the terms of access or otherwise satisfy the IAEA, it comes to an entity called the Joint Commission.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Joint Commission is comprised of all the signatories &mdash; parties, I should say &mdash; to the agreement. So that would be the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the European Union, Russia, China and Iran, ok? So if five of the eight of those members of the Joint Commission say, &lsquo;No, we&rsquo;re concerned, this has to be investigated,&rsquo; and that would just be the United States and our European partners, that makes five, then ... Iran, is bound to grant that access.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>And if it doesn&rsquo;t, if it still refuses, then it is in violation of the entire agreement. So, um, and that entire process has to be completed in 24 days or less.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s in violation, then what happens? What happens is the United States or any of the five permanent members of the Security Council can go straight into the Security Council and say, &lsquo;There has been a, there is a dispute. We believe there has been a violation. There needs to be a meeting of the Security Council. And a decision from the Security Council.&rsquo; There&rsquo;s no need for the other members of the commission to be involved in that. The United States can go straight in itself.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>And then after a process in the Security Council, the United States can unilaterally - or France or the UK or even Russia - can go in unilaterally and say, &lsquo;I want the sanctions to snap back,&rsquo; meaning come back into effect in full immediately. And then there would be a vote which, in which the sanctions would snap back unless the United States said &lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So we, in other words, Jeff, have complete ability on our own, without Iran, without any other country coming to the same conclusion, to go into the Security Council with evidence of a violation after a process and snap those sanctions back into place.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Q. And it&rsquo;s more than a request then for those &mdash;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A. It&rsquo;s not a request. It&rsquo;s a requirement.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Q. You mentioned the 24 days.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A. And by the way, Jeff, just to be clear, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Q. That&rsquo;s all right.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A. We were talking about an access-related violation. There are other potential sorts of violations of the agreement that would not necessarily be related to access. And they, too, are subject to this dispute-resolution procedure that can result in a snap-back of sanctions.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Q. You mentioned the 24 days. Given Iran&rsquo;s history, isn&rsquo;t it likely that they would have some time in that period to hide at least some of evidence of suspicious activity before the inspectors arrived?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A. Good question. But let me also explain why our nuclear experts are very confident that 24 days is plenty &mdash;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Q. It seems like a lot &mdash;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A. Is more than an adequate time and we shouldn&rsquo;t be worried.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>First of all, the kind of facility we&rsquo;re talking about would have to be a secret facility or unknown facility in which nuclear activity was taking place. That&rsquo;s not a place the size of this room or even perhaps the size of this building. That would be a major facility.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>And in that facility, given the nature of the materials we&rsquo;re talking about, which are highly radioactive, and given the sophistication of the testing equipment that the IAEA and we now have, any residual would be detectable for many, many not just days but months and years thereafter.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So they can&rsquo;t hide the evidence of that in any meaningful way in that kind of period of time. And you can&rsquo;t hide a facility of that size very easily for long.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 32, '1437877669.jpg', '', 'zzxxX', 1, '2015-07-27 06:23:27', 'published'),

(258, 'Japanâ€™s pacifism fades, but most Japanese arenâ€™t happy about it', '<p><span>Nearly to the day of the first successful test of a nuclear bomb in 1945, and just a few weeks from the 70</span><span>th</span><span>&nbsp;anniversary of the end of World War Two, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pushed through legislation to give his country&rsquo;s military the power to strike offensively for the first time since the war.</span></p>\r\n<p>It is hard to understate the potential impact of this development.</p>\r\n<p>Domestically, Abe is putting his own job on the line. Voters oppose the new legislation roughly two to one, opposition parties walked out of the vote in protest and the government&rsquo;s support ratings fell to around 40 percent. The lower house of parliament&rsquo;s decision to approve the legislation set off the largest demonstrations in Japan since the Fukushima nuclear accident; a crowd of 100,000 people gathered with signs reading &ldquo;Abe, Quit.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Abe took this action knowing that 55 years ago similar protests forced his grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, out of the prime minister&rsquo;s job after he rammed a revised U.S.-Japan security pact, seen as too militaristic, through parliament.</p>\r\n<p>Abe&rsquo;s move is also darkly symbolic both in and outside Japan.</p>\r\n<p>Most Japanese remain proud of Article 9 in their postwar constitution, through which they became the only nation in modern times to renounce the use of offensive force. Abe&rsquo;s walking his country away from this achievement represents the end of the last great ideal to emerge from World War Two, and an almost contemptuous disregard for his citizens&rsquo; view of themselves.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, as China contests islands in the seas south of Japan, North Korea rattles its nuclear saber and Japan&rsquo;s Southeast Asian neighbors remember their own World War Two experiences, the new legislation throws additional fuel onto the coals of East Asian tensions. China&rsquo;s foreign ministry said the move called into question Japan&rsquo;s postwar commitment to &ldquo;the path of peaceful development&rdquo; and urged Abe to learn the lessons of history.</p>\r\n<p>Chief among the practical concerns in Japan is that Abe&rsquo;s legislative end-run around the constitution will block case-by-case debate on the use of the nation&rsquo;s military.</p>\r\n<p>For example, Japan&rsquo;s only post-World War Two deployment of troops abroad, a single battalion to Iraq in 2004 in support of U.S. reconstruction efforts, met intense scrutiny to the point where the government published images of the small arms the soldiers carried, which were to be used only for self-protection, to assure the public of its non-martial intent. A separate, one-time-only law, passed in the wake of 9/11 to allow Japan to refuel American ships in the Indian Ocean, restricted Japanese vessels to &ldquo;areas where no combat is taking place.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The new legislation does not immediately become law. The measure moves to the upper house, where no vote is expected to be taken. After 60 days, the measure will automatically return to the lower chamber, where Abe&rsquo;s coalition holds a comfortable majority. In theory, the decision could then be challenged in the supreme court as being in violation of Article 9, though the court historically rules in favor of the government.</p>\r\n<p>That addresses the &ldquo;what.&rdquo; The &ldquo;why&rdquo; remains much harder to discern.</p>\r\n<p>Abe says the legislation is in response to threats facing Japan, including from China. He also cites the murder of two Japanese hostages by Islamic State, suggesting his military could have rescued them. While these views play well to the ultranationalists who help fund the prime minister&rsquo;s party, Abe&rsquo;s critics see them as blather; American security guarantees protect Japan without a (Japanese, at least) thumb in the eye of its neighbors. And even if Japan had the special-forces capability to pull off a hostage rescue, such an action seems well within the intent of Article 9.</p>\r\n<p>Abe also says that the new legislation would allow Japan to help defend the United States, something his critics feel could lead to entanglements in U.S. aggression against China, or even in the Middle East. Abe&rsquo;s own arguments about defending Japan aside, one real factor is the United States pushing the leader into a more aggressive stance under the banner of &ldquo;collective defense.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>However, the real &ldquo;why&rdquo; likely rests deep inside Abe. He has long held a hyper-conservative view of World War Two. He stated, for example, that Japanese leaders charged with war crimes were &ldquo;not war criminals under the laws of Japan.&rdquo; American occupiers arrested Abe&rsquo;s grandfather, Kishi, as a war criminal for his role in the war. Some say Kishi, who helped raise Abe, pressed into his grandson his own dream of remaking Japan as a military power and throwing off the postwar constitution.</p>\r\n<p>Abe is a politician who found himself powerful enough to act on his own ideas, apart from what many feel are his nation&rsquo;s legitimate security needs. Abe is apparently willing to pick a fight, risk his job and anger his country, all in service to his own ideology.</p>', 33, 'Japan_pacifism_happy.jpg', '', 'xasxaa', 1, '2015-08-11 14:26:12', 'published'),
(259, 'Behind the clichÃ©: Light or Dark Complexion: Colourism in Bangladesh', '<p>Once, in Dhaka, I was having evening snacks with one of my Australian friends at a fast food restaurant at Dhanmondi in Dhaka. A bunch of university students were chatting beside us. I, with my surprise, observed that after they noticed the white lady&rsquo;s presence, they immediately started their conversation in English. My Australian friend did not understand the reason behind their inclination to English all on a sudden after noticing her. She just exclaimed, &lsquo;I never understood young Bangladeshis.&rsquo; Later on, they literally intruded into our personal space and tried to start a conversation with an over-imposed fake American accent. I wondered, what could be the meaning of such interaction. Was it an act representing our hospitality? Was it an act to show we know English? Or was it an attempt to associate with someone with white skin?</p>\r\n<p>Whatever the answer may be, it seems appropriate to realise that Bangladeshis have an ambiguous and unpredictable mind-set and approach towards white or fair skin. We tend to promote a subjective favour for people with lighter skin colour. Intra-racial colour discrimination is an embarrassing and controversial subject in our country. While many prefer not to discuss it, especially in the professional sectors, others oppose that skin colour bias no longer exists&mdash;that it is history, water over the dam. However, underneath a surface appearance of brown solidarity lies a matrix of attitudes about skin colour and features in which colour, not character, characterises friendships; degree of skin lightness, not expertise, influences job opportunities; and complexion, not talent, dictates casting for television and film. In the world of entertainment in Bangladesh, a superstar with brown skin colour tries to alter his or her features to the point where he or she no longer looks brown on television or broad screens. Explore a little deeper, and you will find a pool of guilt and anger that threatens to overflow, exposing to Bangladeshis the truth that skin colour still matters.</p>\r\n<p>No doubt, a preference towards lighter or &lsquo;fair&rsquo; skin colour has become instinctual for most Bangladeshis. We already are quite aware and having clich&eacute;d discussions on the desired fair skin for women in marriage industry, especially in the male-dominated society in Bangladesh. However, the desire for a fair skin is no longer limited among women. A significant rise in purchasing men&rsquo;s skin lightening cream manifests that the desire has embedded in men&rsquo;s psyche as well. Though I am using the words like &lsquo;lighter&rsquo; or &lsquo;fair,&rsquo; I do believe that these words were initiated by white English speakers to humiliate the black or brown skin colour, insisting on defining the colour as &lsquo;darker.&rsquo; It seems like these words bear discriminating colour politics beyond their apparent meaning. In Bangla, the word&nbsp;<em>shyamal Baran&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>shyamla</em>&nbsp;for brown skin tones has been celebrated in all genres of Bangla literature and artistic creations. Yet, we are keen to observe how&nbsp;<em>farsha</em>&nbsp;or &lsquo;fair&rsquo; a person is. We have internalised the very notion through which white westerners used to demean our identity and skin colour.</p>\r\n<p>The practice of demonstrating an unfair favour for people with lighter skin colour is known as colourism. It is important to remember that prejudice of any kind initiates customs of privilege as well as oppression. Skin colour bias is no different; while many Bangladeshis are hurt by colourism, others benefit of it. Bangladeshis have different tones of brown skin, starting from lighter to darker shades. Apparently, our use of the Bangla word&nbsp;<em>shundar,</em>&nbsp;as a determiner, refers to someone with lighter skin tone. We use the word in a way which poses a discriminatory status, as if we are locating someone special within a crowd of average brown skin tones. We know&nbsp;<em>shundar</em>&nbsp;as a word means the beauty of a person based on his or her achievements, qualities and personality. It refers to both inner and outer beauties. We tend to reduce the significance of such a vibrant Bangla word, and we limit its meaning by keeping it within skin tones. Therefore, a student with lighter skin in a class, or an employee with &lsquo;fair&rsquo; skin in an organization may receive favours that others do not.&nbsp; The trend of colourism has become so instinctual that we fail to realize it may hurt others who do not possess the so called fair skin. In Bangladesh, a dark complexion is an obstacle for many men and women in their way of having marriage or employment prospects.</p>\r\n<p>In South Asia, the caste and discriminatory systems of the white Aryans are frequently referred as a source of colourism. However, I believe the brain-wash performed on Bangladeshis (or on all South Asians) by the British during the colonial period plays a major role in constructing our colour complex. &nbsp;Lord Babington Macaulay presented the &lsquo;Minutes on Indian Education&rsquo; in the British Parliament on 2<span>nd</span>February 1835. Apparently, this proposal on the education of Indian subcontinent constructed the ideology for all South Asians; an ideology that promotes and prefers western values and culture. In his speech, he said, &lsquo;<em>we must at present do our best to form a class who may be interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern; a class of persons, Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals, and in intellect.&rsquo;</em>&nbsp;The white British colonial rulers brain-washed a certain class of South Asians, including Bangladeshis, who, later on, constructed our ideology on class, culture, and beauty. Now we think that everything related with the west or the British is better and sophisticated. We have become engrossed with western culture so much that we even prefer their white skin colour as the colour of beauty. Therefore, we are prone to admire the people who have the &lsquo;fair&rsquo; and white-like skin tones.</p>\r\n<p>Our media also trails after the norms of white beauty established by the British colonial power. There is a number of advertisements promoting skin-lightening creams and promising &lsquo;fair&rsquo; skins.&nbsp; It is a matter of distress when we find Bangladeshis believing in these advertisements and buying the skin-lightening products, which, according to the health researchers, cause cancer. At present, I am studying in Europe, and I find a lot of Europeans asking me about the popularity of skin lightening creams in Bangladesh. To most of them, the idea of skin lightening cream is surprising and humiliating. However, I sense their satisfaction that people in another country are craving for a skin colour similar to their white skin.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Colourism is a creation of white colonial power to intensify our insecurity regarding our skin colour, and we seem eager to confirm and reconfirm the insecurity and promote discrimination in our social space. However, it is true that our perspectives on beauty and skin tones are changing. There are few commercials in Bangladeshi media redefining the concept of beauty. We no longer go for the glamour of Shakib Khan&rsquo;s &lsquo;fair&rsquo; skin; rather we prefer to admire Chanchal Chowdhury, Mosharraf Karim, and Fazlur Rahman Babu, because they represent the everyday people, everyday skin colour. Yet, there are ambiguous and unexplained skin colour complex operating in our minds, and it is high time for us to promote a concept of Bangladeshi beauty that will not consider skin colour at all.</p>', 33, 'Colourism_Bangladesh.jpg', '', 'sdxasdxas', 1, '2015-08-11 14:27:35', 'published'),

To my surprise I found in her English script these two sentences in separate pages along with other short sentences: (1) &lsquo;I have a sister&rsquo;&mdash;for the composition on &lsquo;Myself&rsquo;, and (2) &lsquo;My mother cooks for me&rsquo;&mdash;for another one on &lsquo;My Mother&rsquo;. I went for an interrogation. First question: &lsquo;Why did you write that you have a sister? You DON&rsquo;T!&rsquo; Her reply: &lsquo;Miss wrote it, so I had to write it.&rsquo; Then I asked: &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t you tell her that your mother doesn&rsquo;t cook?&rsquo; &lsquo;I did, but she said it&rsquo;s alright to write it, because sometimes you make dishes'', she replied.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Afterwards I asked her to write sentences about herself and about her mother on her own.</p>\r\n<p>This small incident made me think deeply what we are doing to our children in schools. It was just two days back that one of my ex-students who happens to teach at an English medium school in Dhanmondi was telling me, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see wonder in the little children&rsquo;s eyes&rsquo;, and expressed her fear whether we are creating programmed human beings instead of letting them learn.</p>\r\n<p>When I look back on my school days I can relate to this kind of incidents easily when we had to memorize a ten-sentence paragraph on a particular topic and write the same in the exam scripts. But that was a long time ago! Shouldn&rsquo;t things change as the world is moving faster now? Shouldn&rsquo;t our teaching style change to hone critical thinking skills of our students? Shouldn&rsquo;t we let our children grow up by exploring? The credit that we give to Dhaka-based schools leaving the rest to their unfortunate conditions is not a &lsquo;credit&rsquo; at all, if children go through rote learning at schools these days.</p>\r\n<p>In a specific part of a 12 minute video (Module 04, Pair and Group Work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woNZzjJL9bQ) by University of Oregon under their project &lsquo;Shaping the Way We Teach English&rsquo; we see that a teacher makes groups in the class after explaining the task. Four children in a group read a text on sockeye salmon and choose and write a sentence on the specific given topic in the given coloured paper and hand it over to the teacher who in turn put those individual sentences together to form a paragraph on the board. As the children sit on the rugs in front of the board leaving their chairs and tables, she discusses the sentences with the children.</p>\r\n<p>What is interesting to notice from the close up shots of the group work is the group members help each other with locating the required sentence from the text, spelling out the sentence to the writer, finding mistakes in the writing etc. In the process, children learn about the food, habitat etc. of sockeye salmon by &lsquo;doing&rsquo; something together. In this process the learning actually sticks to them. A few also make mistakes, but that is not a hindrance to learning. They also learn from that mistake and they retain the learning.</p>\r\n<p>According to the Russian psychologist Alexander Zaporozhets, there are two parallel cultural universes&mdash;the adult&rsquo;s and the child&rsquo;s. Consequently, there are two possible approaches for child educators. We can attempt to take children by the scruff of the neck and drag them into the adult culture, attempting to move them prematurely to the next stage of development. Alternatively, we can allow children to live through their childhood as fully as possible, nut work to help them deepen and enrich their child&rsquo;s eye view. In our country educators seem to do the first. Galina Dolya in a book titled&nbsp;<em>Vygotsky in Action in the Early Years: The &lsquo;Key to Learning&rsquo; Curriculum</em>&nbsp;clarifies &lsquo;developmental education&rsquo; by helping children move forward.&nbsp;&lsquo;To do this it must provide challenging experiences that are enjoyable and achievable given the right support.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>Children need the proper nurturing, moulding from the world around them so that they can do things by themselves analytically and creatively. The world that surrounds them now is a fast-paced world. They are techno savvy/digital natives. If the schools fail to tap on the ways by which they learn and they are used to, we all have to take the responsibility. Parents and teachers alike should take the role of nurturer so that the young minds can grow up with all their potentials and contribute meaningfully to the society, the country. Or, one day they will shout at us singing &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t need no education.&rsquo;</p>', 33, 'Peekaboo_Learn_way.jpeg', '', 'gdfdsdg', 1, '2015-08-19 14:12:19', 'published'),
(261, 'A child born today may live to see humanityâ€™s end, unlessâ€¦', '<p>Humans will be extinct in 100 years because the planet will be uninhabitable, according to Australian microbiologist Frank Fenner, one of the leaders of the effort to eradicate smallpox in the 1970s. He blames overcrowding, denuded resources and climate change.</p>\r\n<p>Fenner&rsquo;s prediction is not a sure bet, but he is correct that there is no way emissions reductions will be enough to save us from our trend toward doom. And there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any big global rush to reduce emissions, anyway. When the G7 called on Monday for all countries to reduce carbon emissions to zero in the next 85 years, the scientific reaction was unanimous: That&rsquo;s far too late.</p>\r\n<p>And no possible treaty that emerges from the current United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Bonn, Germany, in preparation for November&rsquo;s United Nations climate conference in Paris, will be sufficient. At this point, lowering emissions is just half the story&mdash;the easy half. The harder half will be an aggressive effort to find the technologies needed to reverse the climate apocalypse that has already begun.</p>\r\n<p>For years now, we have heard that we are at a tipping point. Al Gore warned us in An Inconvenient Truth that immediate action was required if we were to prevent global warming. In 2007, Sir David King, former chief scientific advisor to the British government, declared, &lsquo;Avoiding dangerous climate change is impossible&mdash;dangerous climate change is already here. The question is, can we avoid catastrophic climate change?&rsquo; In the years since, emissions have risen, as have global temperatures. Only two conclusions can be drawn: Either these old warnings were alarmist, or we are already in far bigger trouble than the UN claims. Unfortunately, the latter seems to be the case.</p>\r\n<p>Lowering emissions and moving to cleaner energy sources is a necessary step to prevent catastrophic temperature rises. The general target is to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius. Higher increases&mdash;like the 5C increase currently projected by 2100&mdash;run the risk of widespread flooding, famine, drought, sea-level rise, mass extinction and, worse, the potential of passing a tipping point (frequently set at 6C) that could render much of the planet uninhabitable and wipe out most species. Even the 2C figure predicts more than a meter&rsquo;s rise in sea levels by 2100, enough to displace millions. It is no wonder that the Pentagon calls climate change a serious &lsquo;threat multiplier&rsquo; and is considering its potential disruptive impact across all its planning.</p>\r\n<p>This is where the UN talks fall short&mdash;by a mile. The targets proffered by the United States (a 26 percent to 28 percent decrease from 2005 levels by 2025), the European Union (a 40 per cent decrease from 1990 levels by 2030) and China (an unspecified emissions peak by 2030) are nowhere near enough to keep us under the 2C target. In 2012, journalist Bill McKibben, in a feature for Rolling Stone, explained much of the math behind the current thinking on global warming. He concluded that the United Nations&rsquo; figures were definitely on the rosy side. In particular, McKibben noted that the temperature has already increased 0.8C, and even if we were to stop all carbon-dioxide emissions today, it would increase another 0.8C simply due to the existing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. That leaves only a 0.4C buffer before hitting 2C. Even assuming the Paris conference implements everything that&rsquo;s promised, we will be on track to use up the remaining &lsquo;carbon budget&rsquo;&mdash;the amount of carbon we can emit without blowing past the 2C threshold&mdash;within two to three decades, not even at mid-century.</p>\r\n<p>These emissions-reduction frameworks, it is safe to say, are simply insufficient. By themselves, they only offer a small chance of preventing the earth from becoming mostly uninhabitable&mdash;for humans at least&mdash;over the next few centuries. For the talks to be more than just a placebo, they need to encompass aggressive plans for climate mitigation, with the assumption that current wishful targets won&rsquo;t be met.</p>\r\n<p>Apart from coordination to cope with climate-driven crises and associated instability, climate-change leadership needs to encourage and fund the development of technologies to reverse what we are unable to stop doing to our planet. Many of these technologies fall under the rubric of &lsquo;carbon sequestration&rsquo;&mdash;safely storing carbon rather than emitting it. Riskier strategies, like injecting sulfates into the air to reflect more of the sun&rsquo;s heat into space and ocean iron fertilization to grow algae to suck in carbon, run a high risk of unintended consequences. Better and safer solutions to reduce CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere don&rsquo;t yet exist; we need to discover them and regulate them, to avoid the chaos of what economists Gernot Wagner and Martin L Weitzman term &lsquo;rogue geoengineering&rsquo; in their book Climate Shock.</p>\r\n<p>None of these approaches are substitutes for emissions reductions. Achieving a carbon-neutral society is a necessary long-term goal regardless of other technological fixes. Technology could buy us the time to get there without our planet burning up. Ultimately, we need a Cold War-level of investment in research into new technologies to mitigate the coming effects of global warming. Without it, the UN&rsquo;s work is a nice gesture, but hardly a meaningful one.</p>', 33, 'Human_Rights.jpg', '', 'zazaa', 1, '2015-08-11 14:39:24', 'published'),
(262, 'Great Debate: Is a criminal case the way to clean up FIFA?', '<p>The 161-page indictment filed against 14 individuals connected to FIFA makes depressing reading. It identifies page after page of what the United States Justice Department says are corrupt transactions, usually involving the sale of marketing or broadcast rights relating to national football teams and international competitions, not least the FIFA World Cup.</p>\r\n<p>According to the indictment, the typical scheme went like this: someone senior in the federation (the indictment is entirely related to the federations of North and South America) would sell the distribution rights to a marketing company, which would then sell those rights to a TV channel or sporting goods company that would ultimately make money by selling to customers. As part of this deal, the indictment claims, the marketing company in the middle would facilitate payments to the federation executive. Simple, really. By selling through a (corrupt) intermediary, the football executives could cream off some of the money.</p>\r\n<p>If the charges stand, then the individuals involved could face lengthy jail time and personal ruin. The question is whether the investigation will also lead to the reform of FIFA. The problem is that the organization of a sports federation invites the kind of behavior alleged here, so that while catching a few of the guilty might act as a deterrent, it is unlikely to deal with the fundamental problem. Widespread reform can be elusive, in the same way that arresting a few drug dealers &mdash;&nbsp; no doubt desirable in its own right &mdash; does little to stop the drug trade.</p>\r\n<p>One obvious solution to the corrupt behavior alleged by the Justice Department would be to force sports federations to publish details of all the contracts they sign, with all the numbers, so anyone can see what was paid. It&rsquo;s hard to think of any business in the world that provides that level of transparency, and indeed it&rsquo;s likely that many legitimate buyers of football rights would resist seeing the terms of their contracts made public. These contracts might contain clauses about possible events that the buyers of broadcast rights would prefer to keep private, for example.</p>\r\n<p>But once you allow anything less than complete transparency, the middlemen will find a way to allow both sides the freedom of maneuver that they want. Some will argue that the process of reforming an organization like FIFA is not so much about the rules as about rooting out the corrupt individuals. There are many reasons to be skeptical about the potential to get &lsquo;the right kind of people&rsquo; in charge. The leaders of major sports organizations are ambitious politicians who usually need financial resources in order to maintain their standing. The current controversies about campaign finance in US elections suggest that it is impossible to keep money out of politics, and inevitably people will ask where the money originated.</p>\r\n<p>Perhaps most worryingly for FIFA and the future of the World Cup, it&rsquo;s not even clear that people around the world agree on the meaning of corruption. This is a culturally sensitive issue. In many countries it is the norm to pay individuals a gratuity for making things happen. When you tip a waiter or doorman you don&rsquo;t expect the sum to be public or the transaction to be considered a bribe, even if you follow your tip with &lsquo;Now please find me the best table.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>In northwest Europe and the United States, we have now drawn a sharp distinction between this legal activity and the illegal activity of giving gratuities to public officials or individuals involved in arms-length transactions. Not everyone in the world thinks like this. No doubt there are many executives inside FIFA who, until now, have thought of themselves as &lsquo;clean,&rsquo; but must be wondering if any of their actions might be caught by the Justice Department&rsquo;s promise that &lsquo;this indictment is not the final chapter in our investigation.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>Building a coalition on a global scale &mdash; and that is really what the World Cup and FIFA represent &mdash; requires immense compromises, and often a willingness to not look too deeply into what is going on. Most people might applaud the Justice Department&rsquo;s assault on the worst excesses of FIFA. But if this investigation goes much deeper, resistance might stiffen. The warring parties might break up into regional blocs, and the World Cup itself might be the victim. If that is the price of justice, some might say, then it is a price worth paying.</p>', 33, 'criminal_FIFA.jpg', '', 'dsfsfas', 1, '2015-08-11 14:40:07', 'published');

(263, 'Why the US officially â€˜believesâ€™ Pakistanâ€™s bin Laden story', '<p>Why do allies sometimes pretend to believe one another&rsquo;s lies? There are good reasons and bad, as new evidence about the US relationship with Pakistan demonstrates.</p>\r\n<p>Throughout its &lsquo;war on terrorism,&rsquo; the United States has had to rely on Pakistan. Though Washington may occasionally have believed its trust was abused, the Pentagon&rsquo;s need for overflight rights or landing bases, crucial for US troops in Afghanistan and throughout the Middle East, trumped diplomatic niceties.</p>\r\n<p>The American people may wonder if this trumped self-respect as well. Seasoned investigative reporter Seymour Hersh recently wrote about Pakistan&rsquo;s possibly problematic role in the US capture of Osama bin Laden for the London Review of Books. Hersh, who broke both the My Lai massacre story during the Vietnam War and the Abu Ghraib torture story during the war in Iraq, alleges that Islamabad kept bin Laden under lock and key in Abbottabad for six years &mdash; even as US intelligence urgently tried to track him down. Combing treacherous mountains and ravines for the world&rsquo;s most wanted man, Washington may have risked and lost lives unnecessarily.</p>\r\n<p>New York Times reporter Carlotta Gall agrees with some of Hersh&rsquo;s allegations. She wrote last week that the US government realized Pakistan was undermining its efforts but chose not to make the problem public. Gall confirmed that she learned right after bin Laden&rsquo;s death that a Pakistani army officer probably sold the secret of the al Qaeda leader&rsquo;s whereabouts to the Americans for a cool $25 million. That piece of intelligence &mdash; not six-years worth of CIA blood-hounding &mdash; may be what led right to the compound in Abbottabad.</p>\r\n<p>Would Washington ever tolerate such lies from a friend &mdash; or condone US leaders covering up for them? When President Barack Obama announced bin Laden&rsquo;s death, he said, &lsquo;cooperation with Pakistan helped lead us to bin Laden and the compound in which he was hiding.&rsquo; According to Hersh&rsquo;s reporting, the reverse may have been true.</p>\r\n<p>There are often excellent reasons for not outing a bad ally. In dangerous times, for example, the consequences of a diplomatic rupture can be far worse than swallowing a lie. Poland discovered this during World War Two.</p>\r\n<p>In 1943, Radio Berlin broadcast the discovery of a mass grave of Polish officers in the Katyn Forest, a region previously occupied by the Soviet Union under the infamous Molotov-Ribbentrop pact by which the Nazis and the Soviets had divided Poland between them. The grave contained the remains of more than 20,000 people shot by the Soviet secret police to thwart resistance.</p>\r\n<p>Not long after, Germany turned on Joseph Stalin&rsquo;s empire, took Poland for itself and attacked the Russian homeland. Nazi officials saw revelations of the massacre as an opportunity to drive a wedge between Moscow and its new Western allies, including the Polish government-in-exile.</p>\r\n<p>Stalin resolutely denied the shocking charges, despite the findings of an international Red Cross forensics team that the Nazis invited to Katyn. The British and US governments refused to confront their ally, and tacitly accepted the subsequent conclusions of a Soviet special report that blamed the execution and mass burial (including approximately 8,000 Polish officers) on Nazi Germany. Russia pretended innocence &mdash; and the allies pretended to believe it.</p>\r\n<p>Not surprisingly, the prime minister of the Polish government based in London challenged the story. Wladyslaw Sikorski angrily demanded a thorough, independent investigation. Stalin retaliated by accusing Sikorski of collaborating with the enemy. Russia then broke off diplomatic relations with Poland, nullifying the Sikorski-Mayski treaty that pledged wartime cooperation. The gloves were off.</p>\r\n<p>The consequences for Poland reverberated for 40 years. The Soviet Red Army camped on the opposite side of the Vistula River, waiting while Germany burned Warsaw in 1944. Moscow then refused to recognize the Polish government in 1945 and forced its substitute Communist Polish regime on the country until 1989.</p>\r\n<p>For Poland, it turned out honesty was not the best strategy. Russia finally acknowledged Stalin&rsquo;s crime only in 1990, as part of Mikhail Gorbachev&rsquo;s policy of transparency, or glasnost.</p>\r\n<p>The Katyn massacre is an egregious example of a common phenomenon that is usually far more benign. Nations often look the other way at bad behavior for the simple reason that a cost-benefit analysis would show no point in confrontation. Governments are aware that friends sometimes spy on them, for example. It&rsquo;s obnoxious but not damaging enough to risk the rewards of continued good relations.</p>\r\n<p>The American people, however, have placed a high value on transparency since the founders wrote the Constitution in 1787. The Constitution requires Congress to publish its proceedings. With this, the United States became the first nation in history to require government transparency by law.</p>\r\n<p>Even if one assumed Pakistani duplicity and that the US government was aware of it, telling the truth would not be anywhere near as catastrophic as the wartime rupture between Poland and Russia. Washington is roughly 7,000 miles from Islamabad; Pakistan&rsquo;s regular military cannot hurt the United States and would not wish to. But a public breach of trust may have erased any possibility of future cooperation between the two &lsquo;friends.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>Pakistan was then providing logistical support for the US intervention in neighboring Afghanistan. If Obama knew Pakistan was disloyal, he made the correct short-term choice not to reveal it.</p>\r\n<p>Yet Americans should question their nation&rsquo;s long-term policy. Had the United States not linked its fortunes with Pakistan in the first place, Obama would not have had to accept Islamabad&rsquo;s possible lies &mdash; and tell fresh ones (or at least dissimulate) to the American people.</p>\r\n<p>In 2004, Washington dubbed Islamabad a &lsquo;major non-NATO ally&rsquo; in the war on terror, which entitled Pakistan to foreign aid and new weapons. The United States also lifted economic sanctions previously imposed for illegal nuclear testing. But Pakistan&rsquo;s usefulness as an ally has proved questionable.</p>\r\n<p>Since 1947, the United States has added nation after nation to its roster of allies. From the progressive expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation to the widening of the war on terror, the United States has entangled itself with a larger, increasingly diverse cast of countries.</p>\r\n<p>Not all these relationships work equally well.</p>\r\n<p>Choose your friends wisely, the old saying goes, because you&rsquo;ll end up being like them. Now is the time to evaluate Washington&rsquo;s longtime friends and reinvigorate relations with the most reliable, honest ones.</p>\r\n<p>Pakistan might not make it into the mix.</p>', 33, 'Laden_story.jpg', '', 'xzasa', 1, '2015-08-11 14:40:57', 'published'),

That was, that the economy is growing, don&rsquo;t spoil it; and don&rsquo;t vote for a government which depends on the votes of the Scots Nationalists.</p>\r\n<p>I wrote &lsquo;the mood of England&rsquo;; for Scotland now seems like a foreign country. The Scottish National Party (SNP) wiped Labour, off the map of Scotland &mdash; a map they had dominated for half a century. Though a referendum last September showed a solid Scots majority &ndash; 55 per cent &ndash; for continued union, the Nationalists had seized the sentimental part of the Scots political psyche; the belief that public, perhaps even private, life could be transformed by the notion of &lsquo;governing ourselves.&rsquo; Now, every kind of nationalist party, left or right, will see this surge as an example to follow.</p>\r\n<p>Since secession from the Union isn&rsquo;t a problem in the United States, an American election expert could not be primed to produce a strategy to combat it. Lynton Crosby, the Australian who moved to London to oversee the Conservatives&rsquo; strategy, did have a feel for it. He made the threat of a Nationalist-dominated Labor government the centerpiece of the Conservative campaign. It worked. People talked about it in pubs and at work. Scots aren&rsquo;t unpopular in England &mdash; as a London-residing Scot I can vouch for that &mdash; but the English, 84 percent of the UK population, don&rsquo;t want to follow a political agenda set by Scotland&rsquo;s 8 percent. It was a fear not without reason; and the Conservatives&nbsp; hammered it mercilessly.</p>\r\n<p>With a victory and a parliamentary majority he did not expect, Cameron now dominates the political scene. Naturally, he has some challenges. The largest, for Britain&rsquo;s future, is his promise to hold a referendum by 2017 on whether or not the UK should remain a member of the European Union, which it joined in 1973. The prime minister wants a more detached relationship with the EU, but he doesn&rsquo;t want to leave it &ndash;though a large slice of his party does. He&rsquo;ll have to get some changes in the relationship large enough to impress the doubters, in negotiations he&rsquo;s set to have with his European colleagues.</p>\r\n<p>They &mdash; especially Angela Merkel of Germany &mdash; don&rsquo;t want the UK to go either, since it would further weaken an already fragile Union. But they can&rsquo;t give away the store. The negotiation will be a vivid portrait of how strong &mdash; or how weak &mdash; the EU now feels itself to be: and how many other members wish to follow the UK in loosening the conditions for membership. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>At stake is the future of an institution pledged to &lsquo;ever-closer union&rsquo; &mdash; that doesn&rsquo;t have the crucial fiscal and political powers needed to create a federal state of Europe. National political interests have always trumped closer union. Cameron is about to call his fellow European leaders&rsquo; bluff.</p>\r\n<p>The government thus confronts two of the most serious, and existential, political challenges any government has faced since World War Two. It must strive to keep Scotland, run by a hostile, left-wing, pro-independence party, in the Union; and it must convince other Europeans to allow a loosening of the conditions of membership. The argument Cameron wants to make at home is that the EU is little more than a free trade area with some useful mutual agreements attached.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How far he succeeds will show us how far European leaders still believe in &lsquo;ever-closer union&rsquo; &ndash; or how far they, too, will settle for an end to the grand European narrative in favor of enhanced cooperation.</p>\r\n<p>To succeed in both of these will take political maneuvering&nbsp; of a very high order (and a good deal of luck). David Cameron has been routinely underrated by his opponents, and by many commentators, as a politician who believes in little, a rich man&rsquo;s son with an elite education who slid into politics via public relations.</p>\r\n<p>That script has to be rewritten. He emerges from this election as a formidably subtle and stubborn politician. His first promise in the morning, as he realized his victory, was to run the UK as &lsquo;one nation&rsquo;: the old slogan of left-wing Conservatism, combining patriotism with liberalism, pro-business policies while underpinning the public sector, especially the health service.</p>\r\n<p>With that flag hoisted, he might avoid the rocks ahead. And he won&rsquo;t be hiring Axelrod.</p>', 33, 'Great_death_UK.jpg', '', 'awfsafa', 1, '2015-08-11 14:44:26', 'published'),

The fact that his brothers produced some of his films helped.</p>\r\n<p>But it was his run-in with the law that raised his notoriety quotient.</p>\r\n<p>The Bollywood sweetheart has got a two-day relief on his way to jail, having been sentenced to five years in prison by a sessions court in Mumbai. The 2002 accident had resulted in the death of one person and injury to four others.</p>\r\n<p>The actor is also facing trial for hunting a black buck, a protected species, during the shooting of &lsquo;Hum Saath Saath Hain&rsquo; in 1998. Two parallel cases are running against him - one under the Wildlife Act and the other under the Arms Act.</p>\r\n<p>Even as the actor landed in legal trouble, he was busy giving box office hits.</p>\r\n<p>Earlier, on his way to superstardom, he didn&rsquo;t mind sharing screen space with other leading actors of his era - Sanjay Dutt in &lsquo;Saajan&rsquo; (1991), Aamir Khan in &lsquo;Andaz Apna Apna&rsquo; (1994) - a box office failure, which years later became a cult film for its humorous dialogues - and Shah Rukh Khan in &lsquo;Karan Arjun&rsquo; (1995).</p>\r\n<p>The stepson of yesteryear&rsquo;s dancing diva Helen, Salman featured in his star brothers Sohail and Arbaaz&rsquo;s film productions like &lsquo;Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya&rsquo;, &lsquo;Main Aurr Mrs Khanna&rsquo; and &lsquo;Dabangg&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p>The &lsquo;Biwi No. 1&rsquo; star might have commenced his acting journey as a man all women would love to be with, but in recent years he started creating a name for himself in the action genre by starring in movies like &lsquo;Wanted&rsquo;, &lsquo;Ready&rsquo;, &lsquo;Bodyguard&rsquo; and &lsquo;Kick&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p>He even entertained the masses as a host of TV shows like &lsquo;Bigg Boss&rsquo; and &lsquo;10 Ka Dum&rsquo;. Though the latter didn&rsquo;t click with the audience, &lsquo;Bigg Boss&rsquo; - a controversial reality show that has completed eight seasons - has been one of the reasons why even non-couch potatoes chose to stick to the small screen.</p>\r\n<p>Fondly called &lsquo;Sallu bhai&rsquo; by many, he is also known for launching the careers of actresses like Daisy Shah, Sneha Ullal and Zarine Khan and composers such as Himesh Reshammiya and Sajid-Wajid.</p>\r\n<p>A lot of actors have also gone on record to say they are indebted to Salman. He has been an inspiration to many, especially when it comes to imitating his ''six-pack abs'', including actors like Hrithik Roshan and Arjun Kapoor, who did away with their weighty issues, thanks to Salman.</p>\r\n<p>In fact, Arjun also featured in the popular song &lsquo;Superman...Salman ka fan&rsquo; from &lsquo;Tevar&rsquo; film.</p>\r\n<p>Salman also runs a Being Human Foundation, which supports underprivileged people in India. Started in 2007 in partnership with various companies, the foundation takes initiatives in the field of education and healthcare.</p>\r\n<p>With over Rs.200 crore riding on him, his die-hard fans across the globe may only be eagerly waiting for his films - &lsquo;Bajrangi Bhaijaan&rsquo; and &lsquo;Prem Ratan Dhan Payo&rsquo; - to hit the screens. The infamy associated with his sentencing may even add to the popularity of the films. &nbsp;</p>', 33, 'Salman_Khan.jpg', '', 'dsfdsfsd', 1, '2015-08-20 10:59:14', 'published'),
(267, 'How to counter side effects of antibiotics', '<p>There are times when it becomes unavoidable to take antibiotics. While these may cure you of your diseases, they leave you with nasty side effects like bloating, belching, gas, constipation and diarrhea.</p>\r\n<p>As the very name antibiotics suggests, it kills bacteria. Unfortunately, it also kills friendly bacteria which are so very valuable for your health.</p>\r\n<p>Full one to two kg of friendly bacteria and yeast are present in your intestines. The friendly bacteria not only aid in digestion but also lend a helping hand in manufacturing B vitamins.</p>\r\n<p>Not only that, these keep the omnipresent yeast at bay, thus fighting infection.</p>\r\n<p>As a result of the intake of antibiotics, yeasts grow unchecked into large colonies, causing a condition called dysbiosis. These weaken your immune system.</p>\r\n<p>Here are a few simple steps which can ease the situation considerably.</p>\r\n<p>The first line of defence is cut out factors which forced you to take antibiotics in the first place.</p>\r\n<p>Quit smoking and drinking. Dump all soda. Put aside those chocolates, sugary and starchy foods. Also out are dairy products, fatty and spicy foods, tea and coffee. Increase water intake.</p>\r\n<p>Don''t guzzle orange juice. Vitamin C is better obtained from oranges. Taking it through juices will only supply you excess sugar, which will rather worsen your condition.</p>\r\n<p>Start taking probiotics in the shape of yoghurt on a regular basis, whenever you have a course of antibiotics. Probiotics must be continued long after the course has completed. Even otherwise, it is a good idea to make probiotics a regular part of your diet.</p>\r\n<p>Fermented foods like pickles, pickled turnips and carrots contain natural probiotics. That earthy Kanji that your grandmother used to make will be perfect during your post-antibiotic days.</p>\r\n<p>Eat light, easily digestible food because your digestion will be in bad shape for several months after taking those tiny pills.</p>\r\n<p>Boil five mint leaves, an inch of ginger and about half a teaspoon of Ajwain (carom seeds or bishop''s weed) in a glass of water till the water is reduced to half. Drink half a glass thrice a day.</p>\r\n<p>Light exercise is equally important. What matters is regularity.</p>\r\n<p>Another wonderful remedy in your kitchen is garlic. Allicin present in it gets rid of the antibiotics in the body.</p>\r\n<p>Vitamins A, C, E, zinc and selenium are a great help. Aloe vera juice protects intestinal lining.</p>\r\n<p>Make sure that you don''t get constipated. Psyllium husk and flax seed will not only aid in bowel movement but will also relieve diarrhea by absorbing excess water.</p>\r\n<p>Antibacterial oregano oil taken thrice a day provides considerable help.</p>', 33, 'effects_antibiotics.jpg', '', 'dcvxvzx', 1, '2015-08-11 14:46:00', 'published'),

(269, 'Whoâ€™s fighting for whom in Yemenâ€™s proxy war?', '<p>An aerial campaign on Yemen&rsquo;s capital, launched by a Saudi-led pan-Arab force, has escalated what had in many ways been a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia.</p>\r\n<p>While the worsening war in Yemen shares similarities with other conflicts in the Arab world, it is the role of foreign powers in Yemen&rsquo;s descent into leaderless chaos that is particularly striking.</p>\r\n<p>Because Yemen is viewed as the Arab world&rsquo;s poor brother &mdash; inconsequential and with little influence over the region as a whole &mdash; it serves as an avenue for the Arab world to push back against Iran. There is little other incentive for Arab governments to become involved with Yemen&rsquo;s internal quagmire, other than not having a hostile government in a nation bordering the Bab al-Mandeb strait, a highly trafficked shipping line leading to the Suez Canal.</p>\r\n<p>Though Yemen&rsquo;s domestic power struggle since the end of President Ali Abdullah Saleh&rsquo;s reign three years ago was based largely on local grievances, these two historical foes, Shi&rsquo;ite Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia, worked to use who they could in Yemen for political advantage.</p>\r\n<p>The Saudi kingdom long was Yemen&rsquo;s largest benefactor and held sway over powerful Yemeni tribal leaders. Yet following Saleh&rsquo;s resignation in November 2011, Iran swiftly worked to increase its influence in Yemen by creating ties with whoever shared a common disdain for Saudi Arabia, including liberal anti-Saleh activists.</p>\r\n<p>The Houthi rebels, an oft-ignored militia from Yemen&rsquo;s far north, were an obvious ally for Iran. Houthi fighters, who follow a sect of Shi&rsquo;ite Islam known as Zaydism, consolidated power in the wake of the 2011 government collapse. They are staunchly anti-Saudi. They believe that the Kingdom was involved in the systematic corruption of their distinct Zaydi culture via the promotion of Wahhabism (a strict interpretation of Sunni Islam that began in Saudi Arabia) in the Houthis&rsquo; traditional homeland in the north.</p>\r\n<p>Then last September, Houthi militia swept into Yemen&rsquo;s capital, Sanaa, taking over government institutions and effectively forcing the resignation of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi &mdash; a man whose power stemmed from Western governments and the United Nations, which crafted and promulgated the transition agreement that made him president. There was no real attempt at a democratic transition in Yemen.</p>\r\n<p>Hadi was propped up by the West despite his lack of leadership experience, local support and political savvy. He was far from what the pro-democracy protesters had called for in the early months of the Arab Spring. But for the international community, the theoretical alternative to ushering Hadi into power was that Saleh &mdash; who had already been president for 32 years &mdash; would have clung to power, possibly igniting a civil war. Now that has happened regardless.</p>\r\n<p>Since they took the capital, Houthi militias have continued to push southward, making strategic advances along the way, like taking control of airports. On Thursday they battled pro-Hadi forces outside the port city of Aden, where Hadi had fled. The extent to which Houthis&rsquo; policy is dictated by Tehran remains unknown, but much of the Arab world believes the group is carrying out Iran&rsquo;s will. Arab governments are capitalizing on this ambiguity to serve their political agendas, as evidenced by their push for a military incursion into Yemen. It&rsquo;s the consequence of Iran&rsquo;s challenge to Saudi hegemony over Yemeni politics.</p>\r\n<p>For Yemen, the consequences of foreign powers&rsquo; involvement can be dire. For one, Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s actions seem to prove the proxy war narrative. And that threatens to further cement sectarian tensions, which have already been on the rise. The Shi&rsquo;ite/Sunni rivalry &mdash; such a powerful current in today&rsquo;s Middle East &mdash; was not relevant in Yemen until this past year. Followers of both sects used to pray in the same mosques. That is not the case anymore, and last week&rsquo;s deadly suicide bombings in Zaydi mosques in Sanaa was a terrifying indicator of that increasing divide.</p>', 33, '1437879444.jpg', '', 'asasa', 1, '2015-07-26 05:57:25', 'unpublished'),

The condition is formally known as hypoactive sexual desire disorder, or HSDD.</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;This is the biggest breakthrough in women&rsquo;s sexual health since the advent of &lsquo;the Pill&rsquo;&rsquo; for contraception, The National Consumers League said in a statement. &lsquo;It validates (and) legitimizes female sexuality as an important component of health.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>But Public Citizen, a consumer watchdog group that testified against the drug earlier this year, predicted that Addyi will be pulled from the market within a few years because of &lsquo;serious dangers to women, with little benefit&rsquo; to them. &lsquo;Unfortunately, we haven&rsquo;t heard the last of this drug.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>Sprout&rsquo;s drug has been nicknamed the &lsquo;female Viagra&rsquo; in media reports, even though it does not work like Pfizer Inc&rsquo;s blockbuster Viagra pill for men that in 1998 became the first approved drug for erectile dysfunction.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Rejected Twice</span></p>\r\n<p>The FDA had twice rejected the Raleigh, North Carolina-based firm&rsquo;s drug.

It attempts to activate certain brain pathways.</p>\r\n<p>Palatin in a statement late Tuesday said its drug, if approved, would only be taken as needed, not on a daily basis like Addyi, thereby providing women &lsquo;greater control and flexibility in their treatment.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>Addyi needs to be taken every day. Unlike Viagra, which affects blood flow to the genitals, the new drug works on the brain. It is similar to a class of other drugs known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRI&rsquo;s, that include antidepressants such as Prozac.</p>\r\n<p>Women who took Addyi in a clinical study had an increase of about one sexually satisfying event (SSE) per month compared with those taking a placebo. Advocates claim that increase is meaningful. Critics say the small benefit is outweighed by the drug&rsquo;s risks.</p>\r\n<p>Addyi will come with a prominent &lsquo;boxed warning&rsquo; about side effects, including among people with liver impairment or who take Addyi with alcohol or with medicines known as CYP3A4 inhibitors that include certain steroids.</p>\r\n<p>Originally developed by Germany&rsquo;s Boehringer Ingelheim under its chemical name flibanserin, it was first rejected by the FDA in 2010 after an advisory panel said the benefits did not outweigh the risks. Sprout acquired the drug, conducted additional studies and resubmitted the application. In 2013, the FDA rejected it again.</p>\r\n<p>The rejection sparked a lobbying campaign by Sprout, aided by some women&rsquo;s groups who accused the FDA of gender bias because it had approved Viagra for men &mdash; a charge the FDA vigorously rejected.</p>', 38, '1440060121.jpg', '1440060122.mp4', 'rfasgsa', 1, '2015-08-20 11:14:21', 'published');

(327, 'Iran Nuclear Deal: We are very confident: Susan Rice', '<p>Reuters White House Correspondent Jeff Mason interviewed Susan Rice, National Security Adviser to President Barack Obama, on Wednesday on the Iran nuclear deal. Here is a full transcript of the interview.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Q. Ambassador Rice, thank you very much for joining us today.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A. Good to be with you, Jeff.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Q. I&rsquo;d like to start by just getting straight into the weeds of this deal. It gives Iran 24 days before it has to grant access to suspicious sites. Does this include all military sites? And is granting access an obligation to Iran if the committee decides that? Or is it simply a request as some people have interpreted?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A. Well, let me give you the whole context. In the first instance, recall that all of Iran&rsquo;s known nuclear facilities will be under 24-7 monitoring, continuous monitoring, by the IAEA, so that&rsquo;s the first point. Secondly, the IAEA and international inspectors will have continuous access to the entire supply chain of Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program &mdash; so its uranium mines, its mills, its manufacturing facilities, its centrifuge manufacturing facilities, as well as any facilities that are actually spinning centrifuges. So the whole supply chain has continuous monitoring.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So what we&rsquo;re talking about and what you&rsquo;re asking in your question is, if we have information about a non-declared suspicious site, what is the process for investigating that site. So let me explain it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In the first instance, let&rsquo;s say that the United States, for example, gathers some information that we believe indicates that there is a suspicious or secret site. We would take that information to the IAEA. The IAEA would investigate. The IAEA would go to Iran and say, &lsquo;We want to visit this site. We want to check it out.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>And by checking it out, it&rsquo;s not just visiting, it&rsquo;s doing environmental sampling, soil sampling, radioactive materials would be tested for and if they are detected. If the Iranians said, &lsquo;No, you can&rsquo;t see that site,&rsquo; whether it&rsquo;s a military site or not, the IAEA, if it deems the site suspicious, can ask for access to it. So there are no limitations on the type of facility that can be accessed but there has to be a reasonable suspicion.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So, if Iran says no, what happens is, there is a process that has to conclude finally within 24 days, during which time if Iran and the IAEA can&rsquo;t agree on the terms of access or otherwise satisfy the IAEA, it comes to an entity called the Joint Commission.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Joint Commission is comprised of all the signatories &mdash; parties, I should say &mdash; to the agreement. So that would be the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the European Union, Russia, China and Iran, ok? So if five of the eight of those members of the Joint Commission say, &lsquo;No, we&rsquo;re concerned, this has to be investigated,&rsquo; and that would just be the United States and our European partners, that makes five, then ... Iran, is bound to grant that access.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>And if it doesn&rsquo;t, if it still refuses, then it is in violation of the entire agreement. So, um, and that entire process has to be completed in 24 days or less.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s in violation, then what happens? What happens is the United States or any of the five permanent members of the Security Council can go straight into the Security Council and say, &lsquo;There has been a, there is a dispute. We believe there has been a violation. There needs to be a meeting of the Security Council. And a decision from the Security Council.&rsquo; There&rsquo;s no need for the other members of the commission to be involved in that. The United States can go straight in itself.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>And then after a process in the Security Council, the United States can unilaterally - or France or the UK or even Russia - can go in unilaterally and say, &lsquo;I want the sanctions to snap back,&rsquo; meaning come back into effect in full immediately. And then there would be a vote which, in which the sanctions would snap back unless the United States said &lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So we, in other words, Jeff, have complete ability on our own, without Iran, without any other country coming to the same conclusion, to go into the Security Council with evidence of a violation after a process and snap those sanctions back into place.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Q. And it&rsquo;s more than a request then for those &mdash;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A. It&rsquo;s not a request. It&rsquo;s a requirement.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Q. You mentioned the 24 days.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A. And by the way, Jeff, just to be clear, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Q. That&rsquo;s all right.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A. We were talking about an access-related violation. There are other potential sorts of violations of the agreement that would not necessarily be related to access. And they, too, are subject to this dispute-resolution procedure that can result in a snap-back of sanctions.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Q. You mentioned the 24 days. Given Iran&rsquo;s history, isn&rsquo;t it likely that they would have some time in that period to hide at least some of evidence of suspicious activity before the inspectors arrived?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A. Good question. But let me also explain why our nucl</p>', 32, '1440065773.jpg', '1440065774.mp4', 'agfgaa', 1, '2015-08-20 10:45:20', 'published'),

In such a scenario, the sun would be blocked out by smoke, causing a devastating cooling of the Earth.</p>\r\n<p>If there were another attack like those in Mumbai in 2008 when Pakistan-based terrorists went on a four-day killing spree in the city, India&rsquo;s government &lsquo;may not turn the other cheek&rsquo;, he said.</p>\r\n<p>The risk is all the greater as weapons become more powerful.</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;A single ballistic missile carries almost three times more nuclear explosive power&rsquo; than both the bombs dropped by the US on Hiroshima and Nagasaki together, said Steven Starr of the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>The &lsquo;madman&rsquo; factor</span></p>\r\n<p>Other risks for nuclear conflict are the accidental releasing of a bomb, or the &lsquo;significant possibility&rsquo; that &lsquo;a group of six terrorists with the right knowledge could put a bomb together&rsquo;, said Fitzpatrick.</p>\r\n<p>Ward Wilson of the Rethinking Nuclear Weapons Project said the problem with nuclear deterrence was its reliance on individuals remaining rational.</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;If human beings are fallible, and human beings are involved in nuclear deterrence, then nuclear deterrence is inherently flawed and will one day fail catastrophically.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>He also warned that &lsquo;if you wait long enough then a madman will pop up in one of the nine nuclear states&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p>Such fears have compelled leaders to call for a nuclear-free world.</p>\r\n<p>US President Barack Obama made it an early focus of his foreign policy, warning in a historic 2009 speech in Prague that &lsquo;as more people and nations break the rules, we could reach the point where the centre cannot hold&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p>But despite going on to seal a new treaty with Moscow to reduce deployed nuclear weapons, his progress has stalled and the US is spending billions upgrading its nuclear arsenal.</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;He hasn&rsquo;t had good partners in Russia, in Pakistan, the Senate &mdash; there are reasons why he hasn&rsquo;t been able to make progress,&rsquo; said Fitzpatrick.</p>\r\n<p>Other countries such as France believe nuclear deterrence is more relevant than ever.</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;The international context does not allow for any weakness... the era of nuclear deterrence is therefore not over,&rsquo; President Francois Hollande said in February.</p>\r\n<p>Iran&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif wrote in The Guardian last week that the concept of mutually assured destruction was &lsquo;insane&rsquo; and called for negotiations on a weapons elimination treaty.</p>\r\n<p>But Fitzpatrick says nuclear weapons &lsquo;are not going away anytime in the foreseeable future... as they are seen as the ultimate insurance protecting national security.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>Nuclear pessimists say this means the apocalypse scenario is still on the table.</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;It is a miracle the human race has managed to escape the final nuclear war,&rsquo; said Starr.</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t count on us making it another 70 years.&rsquo;</p>', 32, '1440066245.jpg', '1440066245.mp4', 'agagara', 1, '2015-08-20 10:45:48', 'published'),

The lower house of parliament&rsquo;s decision to approve the legislation set off the largest demonstrations in Japan since the Fukushima nuclear accident; a crowd of 100,000 people gathered with signs reading &ldquo;Abe, Quit.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Abe took this action knowing that 55 years ago similar protests forced his grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, out of the prime minister&rsquo;s job after he rammed a revised U.S.-Japan security pact, seen as too militaristic, through parliament.</p>\r\n<p>Abe&rsquo;s move is also darkly symbolic both in and outside Japan.</p>\r\n<p>Most Japanese remain proud of Article 9 in their postwar constitution, through which they became the only nation in modern times to renounce the use of offensive force. Abe&rsquo;s walking his country away from this achievement represents the end of the last great ideal to emerge from World War Two, and an almost contemptuous disregard for his citizens&rsquo; view of themselves.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, as China contests islands in the seas south of Japan, North Korea rattles its nuclear saber and Japan&rsquo;s Southeast Asian neighbors remember their own World War Two experiences, the new legislation throws additional fuel onto the coals of East Asian tensions. China&rsquo;s foreign ministry said the move called into question Japan&rsquo;s postwar commitment to &ldquo;the path of peaceful development&rdquo; and urged Abe to learn the lessons of history.</p>\r\n<p>Chief among the practical concerns in Japan is that Abe&rsquo;s legislative end-run around the constitution will block case-by-case debate on the use of the nation&rsquo;s military.</p>\r\n<p>For example, Japan&rsquo;s only post-World War Two deployment of troops abroad, a single battalion to Iraq in 2004 in support of U.S. reconstruction efforts, met intense scrutiny to the point where the government published images of the small arms the soldiers carried, which were to be used only for self-protection, to assure the public of its non-martial intent. A separate, one-time-only law, passed in the wake of 9/11 to allow Japan to refuel American ships in the Indian Ocean, restricted Japanese vessels to &ldquo;areas where no combat is taking place.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The new legislation does not immediately become law. The measure moves to the upper house, where no vote is expected to be taken. After 60 days, the measure will automatically return to the lower chamber, where Abe&rsquo;s coalition holds a comfortable majority. In theory, the decision could then be challenged in the supreme court as being in violation of Article 9, though the court historically rules in favor of the government.</p>\r\n<p>That addresses the &ldquo;what.&rdquo; The &ldquo;why&rdquo; remains much harder to discern.</p>\r\n<p>Abe says the legislation is in response to threats facing Japan, including from China. He also cites the murder of two Japanese hostages by Islamic State, suggesting his military could have rescued them. While these views play well to the ultranationalists who help fund the prime minister&rsquo;s party, Abe&rsquo;s critics see them as blather; American security guarantees protect Japan without a (Japanese, at least) thumb in the eye of its neighbors. And even if Japan had the special-forces capability to pull off a hostage rescue, such an action seems well within the intent of Article 9.</p>\r\n<p>Abe also says that the new legislation would allow Japan to help defend the United States, something his critics feel could lead to entanglements in U.S. aggression against China, or even in the Middle East. Abe&rsquo;s own arguments about defending Japan aside, one real factor is the United States pushing the leader into a more aggressive stance under the banner of &ldquo;collective defense.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>However, the real &ldquo;why&rdquo; likely rests deep inside Abe. He has long held a hyper-conservative view of World War Two. He stated, for example, that Japanese leaders charged with war crimes were &ldquo;not war criminals under the laws of Japan.&rdquo; American occupiers arrested Abe&rsquo;s grandfather, Kishi, as a war criminal for his role in the war. Some say Kishi, who helped raise Abe, pressed into his grandson his own dream of remaking Japan as a military power and throwing off the postwar constitution.</p>\r\n<p>Abe is a politician who found himself powerful enough to act on his own ideas, apart from what many feel are his nation&rsquo;s legitimate security needs. Abe is apparently willing to pick a fight, risk his job and anger his country, all in service to his own ideology.</p>', 32, '1440066302.jpg', '1440066302.mp4', 'afasgasg', 1, '2015-08-20 10:46:21', 'published'),
(330, 'Behind the clichÃ©: Light or Dark Complexion: Colourism in Bangladesh', '<p>in Dhaka, I was having evening snacks with one of my Australian friends at a fast food restaurant at Dhanmondi in Dhaka. A bunch of university students were chatting beside us. I, with my surprise, observed that after they noticed the white lady&rsquo;s presence, they immediately started their conversation in English. My Australian friend did not understand the reason behind their inclination to English all on a sudden after noticing her. She just exclaimed, &lsquo;I never understood young Bangladeshis.&rsquo; Later on, they literally intruded into our personal space and tried to start a conversation with an over-imposed fake American accent. I wondered, what could be the meaning of such interaction. Was it an act representing our hospitality? Was it an act to show we know English? Or was it an attempt to associate with someone with white skin?</p>\r\n<p>Whatever the answer may be, it seems appropriate to realise that Bangladeshis have an ambiguous and unpredictable mind-set and approach towards white or fair skin. We tend to promote a subjective favour for people with lighter skin colour. Intra-racial colour discrimination is an embarrassing and controversial subject in our country. While many prefer not to discuss it, especially in the professional sectors, others oppose that skin colour bias no longer exists&mdash;that it is history, water over the dam. However, underneath a surface appearance of brown solidarity lies a matrix of attitudes about skin colour and features in which colour, not character, characterises friendships; degree of skin lightness, not expertise, influences job opportunities; and complexion, not talent, dictates casting for television and film. In the world of entertainment in Bangladesh, a superstar with brown skin colour tries to alter his or her features to the point where he or she no longer looks brown on television or broad screens. Explore a little deeper, and you will find a pool of guilt and anger that threatens to overflow, exposing to Bangladeshis the truth that skin colour still matters.</p>\r\n<p>No doubt, a preference towards lighter or &lsquo;fair&rsquo; skin colour has become instinctual for most Bangladeshis. We already are quite aware and having clich&eacute;d discussions on the desired fair skin for women in marriage industry, especially in the male-dominated society in Bangladesh. However, the desire for a fair skin is no longer limited among women. A significant rise in purchasing men&rsquo;s skin lightening cream manifests that the desire has embedded in men&rsquo;s psyche as well. Though I am using the words like &lsquo;lighter&rsquo; or &lsquo;fair,&rsquo; I do believe that these words were initiated by white English speakers to humiliate the black or brown skin colour, insisting on defining the colour as &lsquo;darker.&rsquo; It seems like these words bear discriminating colour politics beyond their apparent meaning. In Bangla, the word&nbsp;<em>shyamal Baran&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>shyamla</em>&nbsp;for brown skin tones has been celebrated in all genres of Bangla literature and artistic creations. Yet, we are keen to observe how&nbsp;<em>farsha</em>&nbsp;or &lsquo;fair&rsquo; a person is. We have internalised the very notion through which white westerners used to demean our identity and skin colour.</p>\r\n<p>The practice of demonstrating an unfair favour for people with lighter skin colour is known as colourism. It is important to remember that prejudice of any kind initiates customs of privilege as well as oppression. Skin colour bias is no different; while many Bangladeshis are hurt by colourism, others benefit of it. Bangladeshis have different tones of brown skin, starting from lighter to darker shades. Apparently, our use of the Bangla word&nbsp;<em>shundar,</em>&nbsp;as a determiner, refers to someone with lighter skin tone. We use the word in a way which poses a discriminatory status, as if we are locating someone special within a crowd of average brown skin tones. We know&nbsp;<em>shundar</em>&nbsp;as a word means the beauty of a person based on his or her achievements, qualities and personality. It refers to both inner and outer beauties. We tend to reduce the significance of such a vibrant Bangla word, and we limit its meaning by keeping it within skin tones. Therefore, a student with lighter skin in a class, or an employee with &lsquo;fair&rsquo; skin in an organization may receive favours that others do not.&nbsp; The trend of colourism has become so instinctual that we fail to realize it may hurt others who do not possess the so called fair skin. In Bangladesh, a dark complexion is an obstacle for many men and women in their way of having marriage or employment prospects.</p>\r\n<p>In South Asia, the caste and discriminatory systems of the white Aryans are frequently referred as a source of colourism. However, I believe the brain-wash performed on Bangladeshis (or on all South Asians) by the British during the colonial period plays a major role in constructing our colour complex. &nbsp;Lord Babington Macaulay presented the &lsquo;Minutes on Indian Education&rsquo; in the British Parliament on 2<span>nd</span>February 1835. Apparently, this proposal on the education of Indian subcontinent constructed the ideology for all South Asians; an ideology that promotes and prefers western values and culture. In his speech, he said, &lsquo;<em>we must at present do our best to form a class who may be interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern; a class of persons, Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals, and in intellect.&rsquo;</em>&nbsp;The white British colonial rulers brain-washed a certain class of South Asians, including Bangladeshis, who, later on, constructed our ideology on class, culture, and beauty. Now we think that everything related with the west or the British is better and sophisticated. We have become engrossed with western culture so much that we even prefer their white skin colour as the colour of beauty. Therefore, we are prone to admire the people who have the &lsquo;fair&rsquo; and white-like skin tones.</p>\r\n<p>Our media also trails after the norms of white beauty established by the British colonial power. There is a number of advertisements promoting skin-lightening creams and promising &lsquo;fair&rsquo; skins.&nbsp; It is a matter of distress when we find Bangladeshis believing in these advertisements and buying the skin-lightening products, which, according to the health researchers, cause cancer. At present, I am studying in Europe, and I find a lot of Europeans asking me about the popularity of skin lightening creams in Bangladesh. To most of them, the idea of skin lightening cream is surprising and humiliating. However, I sense their satisfaction that people in another country are craving for a skin colour similar to their white skin.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Colourism is a creation of white colonial power to intensify our insecurity regarding our skin colour, and we seem eager to confirm and reconfirm the insecurity and promote discrimination in our social space. However, it is true that our perspectives on beauty and skin tones are changing. There are few commercials in Bangladeshi media redefining the concept of beauty. We no longer go for the glamour of Shakib Khan&rsquo;s &lsquo;fair&rsquo; skin; rather we prefer to admire Chanchal Chowdhury, Mosharraf Karim, and Fazlur Rahman Babu, because they represent the everyday people, everyday skin colour. Yet, there are ambiguous and unexplained skin colour complex operating in our minds, and it is high time for us to promote a concept of Bangladeshi beauty that will not consider skin colour at all.</p>', 32, '1440066367.jpg', '1440066368.mp4', 'afsasgasd', 1, '2015-08-20 10:47:23', 'published'),
(331, 'Peekaboo: Learn it â€˜thatâ€™ way', '<p><em>Education must be oriented not towards the yesterday of a child&rsquo;s development, but towards its tomorrow.&rsquo; - Lev Vygotsky</em></p>\r\n<p>My five and half year old daughter was having her study time with me. To my surprise I found in her English script these two sentences in separate pages along with other short sentences: (1) &lsquo;I have a sister&rsquo;&mdash;for the composition on &lsquo;Myself&rsquo;, and (2) &lsquo;My mother cooks for me&rsquo;&mdash;for another one on &lsquo;My Mother&rsquo;. I went for an interrogation. First question: &lsquo;Why did you write that you have a sister? You DON&rsquo;T!&rsquo; Her reply: &lsquo;Miss wrote it, so I had to write it.&rsquo; Then I asked: &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t you tell her that your mother doesn&rsquo;t cook?&rsquo; &lsquo;I did, but she said it&rsquo;s alright to write it, because sometimes you make dishes'', she replied.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Afterwards I asked her to write sentences about herself and about her mother on her own.</p>\r\n<p>This small incident made me think deeply what we are doing to our children in schools. It was just two days back that one of my ex-students who happens to teach at an English medium school in Dhanmondi was telling me, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see wonder in the little children&rsquo;s eyes&rsquo;, and expressed her fear whether we are creating programmed human beings instead of letting them learn.</p>\r\n<p>When I look back on my school days I can relate to this kind of incidents easily when we had to memorize a ten-sentence paragraph on a particular topic and write the same in the exam scripts. But that was a long time ago! Shouldn&rsquo;t things change as the world is moving faster now? Shouldn&rsquo;t our teaching style change to hone critical thinking skills of our students? Shouldn&rsquo;t we let our children grow up by exploring? The credit that we give to Dhaka-based schools leaving the rest to their unfortunate conditions is not a &lsquo;credit&rsquo; at all, if children go through rote learning at schools these days.</p>\r\n<p>In a specific part of a 12 minute video (Module 04, Pair and Group Work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woNZzjJL9bQ) by University of Oregon under their project &lsquo;Shaping the Way We Teach English&rsquo; we see that a teacher makes groups in the class after explaining the task. Four children in a group read a text on sockeye salmon and choose and write a sentence on the specific given topic in the given coloured paper and hand it over to the teacher who in turn put those individual sentences together to form a paragraph on the board. As the children sit on the rugs in front of the board leaving their chairs and tables, she discusses the sentences with the children.</p>\r\n<p>What is interesting to notice from the close up shots of the group work is the group members help each other with locating the required sentence from the text, spelling out the sentence to the writer, finding mistakes in the writing etc. In the process, children learn about the food, habitat etc. of sockeye salmon by &lsquo;doing&rsquo; something together. In this process the learning actually sticks to them. A few also make mistakes, but that is not a hindrance to learning. They also learn from that mistake and they retain the learning.</p>\r\n<p>According to the Russian psychologist Alexander Zaporozhets, there are two parallel cultural universes&mdash;the adult&rsquo;s and the child&rsquo;s. Consequently, there are two possible approaches for child educators. We can attempt to take children by the scruff of the neck and drag them into the adult culture, attempting to move them prematurely to the next stage of development. Alternatively, we can allow children to live through their childhood as fully as possible, nut work to help them deepen and enrich their child&rsquo;s eye view. In our country educators seem to do the first. Galina Dolya in a book titled&nbsp;<em>Vygotsky in Action in the Early Years: The &lsquo;Key to Learning&rsquo; Curriculum</em>&nbsp;clarifies &lsquo;developmental education&rsquo; by helping children move forward.&nbsp;&lsquo;To do this it must provide challenging experiences that are enjoyable and achievable given the right support.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>Children need the proper nurturing, moulding from the world around them so that they can do things by themselves analytically and creatively. The world that surrounds them now is a fast-paced world. They are techno savvy/digital natives. If the schools fail to tap on the ways by which they learn and they are used to, we all have to take the responsibility. Parents and teachers alike should take the role of nurturer so that the young minds can grow up with all their potentials and contribute meaningfully to the society, the country. Or, one day they will shout at us singing &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t need no education.&rsquo;</p>', 32, '1440066438.jpg', '1440066439.mp4', 'afdasvfgadsgv', 1, '2015-08-20 10:48:03', 'published'),
(332, 'A child born today may live to see humanityâ€™s end, unlessâ€¦', '<p>Humans will be extinct in 100 years because the planet will be uninhabitable, according to Australian microbiologist Frank Fenner, one of the leaders of the effort to eradicate smallpox in the 1970s. He blames overcrowding, denuded resources and climate change.</p>\r\n<p>Fenner&rsquo;s prediction is not a sure bet, but he is correct that there is no way emissions reductions will be enough to save us from our trend toward doom. And there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any big global rush to reduce emissions, anyway. When the G7 called on Monday for all countries to reduce carbon emissions to zero in the next 85 years, the scientific reaction was unanimous: That&rsquo;s far too late.</p>\r\n<p>And no possible treaty that emerges from the current United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Bonn, Germany, in preparation for November&rsquo;s United Nations climate conference in Paris, will be sufficient. At this point, lowering emissions is just half the story&mdash;the easy half. The harder half will be an aggressive effort to find the technologies needed to reverse the climate apocalypse that has already begun.</p>\r\n<p>For years now, we have heard that we are at a tipping point. Al Gore warned us in An Inconvenient Truth that immediate action was required if we were to prevent global warming. In 2007, Sir David King, former chief scientific advisor to the British government, declared, &lsquo;Avoiding dangerous climate change is impossible&mdash;dangerous climate change is already here. The question is, can we avoid catastrophic climate change?&rsquo; In the years since, emissions have risen, as have global temperatures. Only two conclusions can be drawn: Either these old warnings were alarmist, or we are already in far bigger trouble than the UN claims. Unfortunately, the latter seems to be the case.</p>\r\n<p>Lowering emissions and moving to cleaner energy sources is a necessary step to prevent catastrophic temperature rises. The general target is to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius. Higher increases&mdash;like the 5C increase currently projected by 2100&mdash;run the risk of widespread flooding, famine, drought, sea-level rise, mass extinction and, worse, the potential of passing a tipping point (frequently set at 6C) that could render much of the planet uninhabitable and wipe out most species. Even the 2C figure predicts more than a meter&rsquo;s rise in sea levels by 2100, enough to displace millions. It is no wonder that the Pentagon calls climate change a serious &lsquo;threat multiplier&rsquo; and is considering its potential disruptive impact across all its planning.</p>\r\n<p>This is where the UN talks fall short&mdash;by a mile. The targets proffered by the United States (a 26 percent to 28 percent decrease from 2005 levels by 2025), the European Union (a 40 per cent decrease from 1990 levels by 2030) and China (an unspecified emissions peak by 2030) are nowhere near enough to keep us under the 2C target. In 2012, journalist Bill McKibben, in a feature for Rolling Stone, explained much of the math behind the current thinking on global warming. He concluded that the United Nations&rsquo; figures were definitely on the rosy side. In particular, McKibben noted that the temperature has already increased 0.8C, and even if we were to stop all carbon-dioxide emissions today, it would increase another 0.8C simply due to the existing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. That leaves only a 0.4C buffer before hitting 2C. Even assuming the Paris conference implements everything that&rsquo;s promised, we will be on track to use up the remaining &lsquo;carbon budget&rsquo;&mdash;the amount of carbon we can emit without blowing past the 2C threshold&mdash;within two to three decades, not even at mid-century.</p>\r\n<p>These emissions-reduction frameworks, it is safe to say, are simply insufficient. By themselves, they only offer a small chance of preventing the earth from becoming mostly uninhabitable&mdash;for humans at least&mdash;over the next few centuries. For the talks to be more than just a placebo, they need to encompass aggressive plans for climate mitigation, with the assumption that current wishful targets won&rsquo;t be met.</p>\r\n<p>Apart from coordination to cope with climate-driven crises and associated instability, climate-change leadership needs to encourage and fund the development of technologies to reverse what we are unable to stop doing to our planet. Many of these technologies fall under the rubric of &lsquo;carbon sequestration&rsquo;&mdash;safely storing carbon rather than emitting it. Riskier strategies, like injecting sulfates into the air to reflect more of the sun&rsquo;s heat into space and ocean iron fertilization to grow algae to suck in carbon, run a high risk of unintended consequences. Better and safer solutions to reduce CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere don&rsquo;t yet exist; we need to discover them and regulate them, to avoid the chaos of what economists Gernot Wagner and Martin L Weitzman term &lsquo;rogue geoengineering&rsquo; in their book Climate Shock.</p>\r\n<p>None of these approaches are substitutes for emissions reductions. Achieving a carbon-neutral society is a necessary long-term goal regardless of other technological fixes. Technology could buy us the time to get there without our planet burning up. Ultimately, we need a Cold War-level of investment in research into new technologies to mitigate the coming effects of global warming. Without it, the UN&rsquo;s work is a nice gesture, but hardly a meaningful one.</p>', 32, '1440066555.jpg', '1440066556.mp4', 'afsdafgdsafa', 1, '2015-08-20 10:48:32', 'published'),
(333, 'Great Debate: Is a criminal case the way to clean up FIFA?', '<p>The 161-page indictment filed against 14 individuals connected to FIFA makes depressing reading. It identifies page after page of what the United States Justice Department says are corrupt transactions, usually involving the sale of marketing or broadcast rights relating to national football teams and international competitions, not least the FIFA World Cup.</p>\r\n<p>According to the indictment, the typical scheme went like this: someone senior in the federation (the indictment is entirely related to the federations of North and South America) would sell the distribution rights to a marketing company, which would then sell those rights to a TV channel or sporting goods company that would ultimately make money by selling to customers. As part of this deal, the indictment claims, the marketing company in the middle would facilitate payments to the federation executive. Simple, really. By selling through a (corrupt) intermediary, the football executives could cream off some of the money.</p>\r\n<p>If the charges stand, then the individuals involved could face lengthy jail time and personal ruin. The question is whether the investigation will also lead to the reform of FIFA. The problem is that the organization of a sports federation invites the kind of behavior alleged here, so that while catching a few of the guilty might act as a deterrent, it is unlikely to deal with the fundamental problem. Widespread reform can be elusive, in the same way that arresting a few drug dealers &mdash;&nbsp; no doubt desirable in its own right &mdash; does little to stop the drug trade.</p>\r\n<p>One obvious solution to the corrupt behavior alleged by the Justice Department would be to force sports federations to publish details of all the contracts they sign, with all the numbers, so anyone can see what was paid. It&rsquo;s hard to think of any business in the world that provides that level of transparency, and indeed it&rsquo;s likely that many legitimate buyers of football rights would resist seeing the terms of their contracts made public. These contracts might contain clauses about possible events that the buyers of broadcast rights would prefer to keep private, for example.</p>\r\n<p>But once you allow anything less than complete transparency, the middlemen will find a way to allow both sides the freedom of maneuver that they want. Some will argue that the process of reforming an organization like FIFA is not so much about the rules as about rooting out the corrupt individuals. There are many reasons to be skeptical about the potential to get &lsquo;the right kind of people&rsquo; in charge. The leaders of major sports organizations are ambitious politicians who usually need financial resources in order to maintain their standing. The current controversies about campaign finance in US elections suggest that it is impossible to keep money out of politics, and inevitably people will ask where the money originated.</p>\r\n<p>Perhaps most worryingly for FIFA and the future of the World Cup, it&rsquo;s not even clear that people around the world agree on the meaning of corruption. This is a culturally sensitive issue. In many countries it is the norm to pay individuals a gratuity for making things happen. When you tip a waiter or doorman you don&rsquo;t expect the sum to be public or the transaction to be considered a bribe, even if you follow your tip with &lsquo;Now please find me the best table.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>In northwest Europe and the United States, we have now drawn a sharp distinction between this legal activity and the illegal activity of giving gratuities to public officials or individuals involved in arms-length transactions. Not everyone in the world thinks like this. No doubt there are many executives inside FIFA who, until now, have thought of themselves as &lsquo;clean,&rsquo; but must be wondering if any of their actions might be caught by the Justice Department&rsquo;s promise that &lsquo;this indictment is not the final chapter in our investigation.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>Building a coalition on a global scale &mdash; and that is really what the World Cup and FIFA represent &mdash; requires immense compromises, and often a willingness to not look too deeply into what is going on. Most people might applaud the Justice Department&rsquo;s assault on the worst excesses of FIFA. But if this investigation goes much deeper, resistance might stiffen. The warring parties might break up into regional blocs, and the World Cup itself might be the victim. If that is the price of justice, some might say, then it is a price worth paying.</p>', 32, '1440066643.jpg', '1440066644.mp4', 'afafgasgs', 1, '2015-08-20 10:53:16', 'published'),
(334, 'Why the US officially â€˜believesâ€™ Pakistanâ€™s bin Laden story', '<p>Why do allies sometimes pretend to believe one another&rsquo;s lies? There are good reasons and bad, as new evidence about the US relationship with Pakistan demonstrates.</p>\r\n<p>Throughout its &lsquo;war on terrorism,&rsquo; the United States has had to rely on Pakistan. Though Washington may occasionally have believed its trust was abused, the Pentagon&rsquo;s need for overflight rights or landing bases, crucial for US troops in Afghanistan and throughout the Middle East, trumped diplomatic niceties.</p>\r\n<p>The American people may wonder if this trumped self-respect as well. Seasoned investigative reporter Seymour Hersh recently wrote about Pakistan&rsquo;s possibly problematic role in the US capture of Osama bin Laden for the London Review of Books. Hersh, who broke both the My Lai massacre story during the Vietnam War and the Abu Ghraib torture story during the war in Iraq, alleges that Islamabad kept bin Laden under lock and key in Abbottabad for six years &mdash; even as US intelligence urgently tried to track him down. Combing treacherous mountains and ravines for the world&rsquo;s most wanted man, Washington may have risked and lost lives unnecessarily.</p>\r\n<p>New York Times reporter Carlotta Gall agrees with some of Hersh&rsquo;s allegations. She wrote last week that the US government realized Pakistan was undermining its efforts but chose not to make the problem public. Gall confirmed that she learned right after bin Laden&rsquo;s death that a Pakistani army officer probably sold the secret of the al Qaeda leader&rsquo;s whereabouts to the Americans for a cool $25 million. That piece of intelligence &mdash; not six-years worth of CIA blood-hounding &mdash; may be what led right to the compound in Abbottabad.</p>\r\n<p>Would Washington ever tolerate such lies from a friend &mdash; or condone US leaders covering up for them? When President Barack Obama announced bin Laden&rsquo;s death, he said, &lsquo;cooperation with Pakistan helped lead us to bin Laden and the compound in which he was hiding.&rsquo; According to Hersh&rsquo;s reporting, the reverse may have been true.</p>\r\n<p>There are often excellent reasons for not outing a bad ally. In dangerous times, for example, the consequences of a diplomatic rupture can be far worse than swallowing a lie. Poland discovered this during World War Two.</p>\r\n<p>In 1943, Radio Berlin broadcast the discovery of a mass grave of Polish officers in the Katyn Forest, a region previously occupied by the Soviet Union under the infamous Molotov-Ribbentrop pact by which the Nazis and the Soviets had divided Poland between them. The grave contained the remains of more than 20,000 people shot by the Soviet secret police to thwart resistance.</p>\r\n<p>Not long after, Germany turned on Joseph Stalin&rsquo;s empire, took Poland for itself and attacked the Russian homeland. Nazi officials saw revelations of the massacre as an opportunity to drive a wedge between Moscow and its new Western allies, including the Polish government-in-exile.</p>\r\n<p>Stalin resolutely denied the shocking charges, despite the findings of an international Red Cross forensics team that the Nazis invited to Katyn. The British and US governments refused to confront their ally, and tacitly accepted the subsequent conclusions of a Soviet special report that blamed the execution and mass burial (including approximately 8,000 Polish officers) on Nazi Germany. Russia pretended innocence &mdash; and the allies pretended to believe it.</p>\r\n<p>Not surprisingly, the prime minister of the Polish government based in London challenged the story. Wladyslaw Sikorski angrily demanded a thorough, independent investigation. Stalin retaliated by accusing Sikorski of collaborating with the enemy. Russia then broke off diplomatic relations with Poland, nullifying the Sikorski-Mayski treaty that pledged wartime cooperation. The gloves were off.</p>\r\n<p>The consequences for Poland reverberated for 40 years. The Soviet Red Army camped on the opposite side of the Vistula River, waiting while Germany burned Warsaw in 1944. Moscow then refused to recognize the Polish government in 1945 and forced its substitute Communist Polish regime on the country until 1989.</p>\r\n<p>For Poland, it turned out honesty was not the best strategy. Russia finally acknowledged Stalin&rsquo;s crime only in 1990, as part of Mikhail Gorbachev&rsquo;s policy of transparency, or glasnost.</p>\r\n<p>The Katyn massacre is an egregious example of a common phenomenon that is usually far more benign. Nations often look the other way at bad behavior for the simple reason that a cost-benefit analysis would show no point in confrontation. Governments are aware that friends sometimes spy on them, for example. It&rsquo;s obnoxious but not damaging enough to risk the rewards of continued good relations.</p>\r\n<p>The American people, however, have placed a high value on transparency since the founders wrote the Constitution in 1787. The Constitution requires Congress to publish its proceedings. With this, the United States became the first nation in history to require government transparency by law.</p>\r\n<p>Even if one assumed Pakistani duplicity and that the US government was aware of it, telling the truth would not be anywhere near as catastrophic as the wartime rupture between Poland and Russia. Washington is roughly 7,000 miles from Islamabad; Pakistan&rsquo;s regular military cannot hurt the United States and would not wish to. But a public breach of trust may have erased any possibility of future cooperation between the two &lsquo;friends.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>Pakistan was then providing logistical support for the US intervention in neighboring Afghanistan. If Obama knew Pakistan was disloyal, he made the correct short-term choice not to reveal it.</p>\r\n<p>Yet Americans should question their nation&rsquo;s long-term policy. Had the United States not linked its fortunes with Pakistan in the first place, Obama would not have had to accept Islamabad&rsquo;s possible lies &mdash; and tell fresh ones (or at least dissimulate) to the American people.</p>\r\n<p>In 2004, Washington dubbed Islamabad a &lsquo;major non-NATO ally&rsquo; in the war on terror, which entitled Pakistan to foreign aid and new weapons. The United States also lifted economic sanctions previously imposed for illegal nuclear testing. But Pakistan&rsquo;s usefulness as an ally has proved questionable.</p>\r\n<p>Since 1947, the United States has added nation after nation to its roster of allies. From the progressive expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation to the widening of the war on terror, the United States has entangled itself with a larger, increasingly diverse cast of countries.</p>\r\n<p>Not all these relationships work equally well.</p>', 32, '1440066869.jpg', '1440066870.mp4', 'awfasdga', 1, '2015-08-20 10:55:08', 'published');

Rajaratnam School of International Studies.</p>\r\n<p>With increased Southeast Asian investment coming in since Myanmar''s political opening-up in 2011, the country may be increasingly susceptible to leverage, some believe.</p>\r\n<p>But prospects for securing a change on the Rohingya remain uncertain with the government focused on crucial elections later this year, Buddhist nationalist sentiment strong, and little or no domestic pressure on the issue.</p>\r\n<p>Myanmar already has snubbed Thailand''s call for a regional summit on the crisis, saying the migrants were not its problem.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Nowhere for Rohingya to go</span></p>\r\n<p>Sriprapha Petcharamesree, a Thai former representative to ASEAN''s human rights commission, said Myanmar routinely rejects any overtures on the Rohingya.</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;Even offers from ASEAN to assist on a humanitarian basis were rejected on the grounds that it involves the internal affairs of Myanmar,&rsquo; she said.</p>\r\n<p>Even if Myanmar were to relent, that may not stem the outflow, said Abdul Hamid, head of the Rohingya Society of Malaysia.</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;After all their suffering, many Rohingya don''t want to be there anymore. They don''t trust the Burmese (government) and they want to leave. They feel it is not a country for them.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>Myanmar''s ASEAN partners share much of the blame, critics say, for providing the &lsquo;pull&rsquo; factor, particularly Malaysia, the primary destination for most Rohingya and Bangladeshis.</p>\r\n<p>Malaysia has for years looked the other way as illegal immigrants have come in, utilising their cheap labour while denying them many basic protections, said Brennan.</p>\r\n<p>Corrupt officials in the region are believed to help facilitate the flow.</p>\r\n<p>Increasingly brutal human-traffickers have profited, turning recently to offering many migrants free passage to Malaysia only to later hold them for ransom in Thailand, killing some whose families don''t pay, according to anti-trafficking activists.</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;Now that the problem has worsened, the spotlight is on governments to act,&rsquo; said Brennan.</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;Myanmar must stop the persecution of the Rohingya, so too the oppressive circumstances in Bangladesh must abate, while trafficking and corruption must be faced head-on by governments,&rsquo; he said, adding that the issue will be a &lsquo;litmus test&rsquo; for ASEAN.</p>', 32, 'Migrant_crisis_Southeas.jpg', '1440067061.mp4', 'afdfasga', 1, '2015-09-03 09:58:15', 'published'),

The fact that his brothers produced some of his films helped.</p>\r\n<p>But it was his run-in with the law that raised his notoriety quotient.</p>\r\n<p>The Bollywood sweetheart has got a two-day relief on his way to jail, having been sentenced to five years in prison by a sessions court in Mumbai.

Two parallel cases are running against him - one under the Wildlife Act and the other under the Arms Act.</p>\r\n<p>Even as the actor landed in legal trouble, he was busy giving box office hits.</p>\r\n<p>Earlier, on his way to superstardom, he didn&rsquo;t mind sharing screen space with other leading actors of his era - Sanjay Dutt in &lsquo;Saajan&rsquo; (1991), Aamir Khan in &lsquo;Andaz Apna Apna&rsquo; (1994) - a box office failure, which years later became a cult film for its humorous dialogues - and Shah Rukh Khan in &lsquo;Karan Arjun&rsquo; (1995).</p>\r\n<p>The stepson of yesteryear&rsquo;s dancing diva Helen, Salman featured in his star brothers Sohail and Arbaaz&rsquo;s film productions like &lsquo;Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya&rsquo;, &lsquo;Main Aurr Mrs Khanna&rsquo; and &lsquo;Dabangg&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p>The &lsquo;Biwi No. 1&rsquo; star might have commenced his acting journey as a man all women would love to be with, but in recent years he started creating a name for himself in the action genre by starring in movies like &lsquo;Wanted&rsquo;, &lsquo;Ready&rsquo;, &lsquo;Bodyguard&rsquo; and &lsquo;Kick&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p>He even entertained the masses as a host of TV shows like &lsquo;Bigg Boss&rsquo; and &lsquo;10 Ka Dum&rsquo;.

His only options were to line up prohibitively expensive one-off production in the U.S. or deal with high minimum orders and suspicious quality from manufacturers overseas.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I was doing everything out of my own pocket,&rdquo; Emery says, &ldquo;and I only needed 10 circuit boards at first.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Enter MacroFab, the Houston-based manufacturer started by tech industry veteran Chris Church and electrical engineer Parker Dillmann. Church launched MacroFab after enduring similar pain manufacturing a time-lapse security camera as head of another company he founded, Dynamic Perception.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Being from software, I wanted to make manufacturing hardware more like creating software,&rdquo; Church says. &ldquo;In software, when I needed a piece of code to do a certain task, I could go out and find it and plug it in. I thought hardware could work the same way.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>In traditional hardware manufacturing, an inventor sends designs to a manufacturer and waits&mdash;often for weeks&mdash;for a quote based on a sizable, and costly, first run of product. But with Kickstarter and the maker movement spawning thousands of electronic hardware inventions, Church knew there was an opportunity to help entrepreneurs build prototypes and manufacture their first few thousand orders, whether they were building a new cellphone or a purpose-built laptop for a limited market.</p>\r\n<p>To reach his goal, Church started with the front end, building a web-accessed program that takes a customer&rsquo;s design and automatically finds and prices the raw materials and parts to build it. The program also determines the cost to manufacture the design in MacroFab&rsquo;s factory, which Church set up with refurbished equipment cast off from the likes of Foxconn and Flextronics.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;All the customer has to do is upload their design and specs and then press &lsquo;Order,&rsquo;&rdquo; Church says.</p>\r\n<p>Nashville, Tenn.-based MetaMorph uses MacroFab to produce the open-source hardware it is building for Google&rsquo;s Project Ara, a development effort for an affordable smartphone that lets users buy and plug in the modules they want, such as a camera, sensors or extra-large battery. As MetaMorph develops its ideas, it can get prototypes made on-demand at MacroFab. &ldquo;Having a manufacturer that can build whatever we want, whenever we need it, has made us a lot more legit,&rdquo; says MetaMorph CEO Justin Knight. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re getting us to a more reliable state, and right now that&rsquo;s more important than speed or cost.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Church concedes that MacroFab charges more per unit than overseas manufacturers, but his model allows for production runs of as few as one unit. He says it&rsquo;s more critical that a client get a quality product to market for testing than obsessing too soon over costs and margins. Plus, he points out that the more products that are run through the system, the smarter it becomes at reducing costs by spreading parts orders among multiple products and streamlining production.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We want to be thought of more like a cloud factory&mdash;the Amazon Web Services of manufacturing,&rdquo; Church says. &ldquo;Ultimately, we want to be able to take your design and deliver a finished product straight to your customers.&rdquo;</p>', 29, '1441357900.jpeg', '1441357900.mp4', 'Youtube urlppppppppppppppppppp', 1, '2015-09-04 18:11:40', 'unpublished'),

Every company, regardless of size, the service they provide or the product they produce wants to at least be&nbsp;<em>perceived</em>as being innovative, regardless of the reality. In fact, the word is so over-used that it''s quickly joining the ranks of the now-meaningless buzzword brigade, nestled securely between "cutting&nbsp;edge" and "game changing."</p>\r\n<p>Most companies, particularly startups, are challenged simply by the pressures of our economic climate to innovate or die. It''s enough to drive a budding entrepreneur insane. How can you possibly constantly&nbsp;create&nbsp;the next industry-shaping idea?&nbsp;You see that lightning over there? Here''s a bottle. Best of luck.</p>\r\n<p><span>Related:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/249694">5 Ways to Create a More Innovative Business</a></span></p>\r\n<p>Here''s the reality though: innovation is a double-edged sword. Everyone has to be perceived to be constantly innovative to have a chance of standing out from the crowd in today''s crowded technology marketplace. But innovation merely for the sake of it is meaningless, at least to the majority of us. Sure, some of those monster companies out there can dedicate entire divisions to building teleporters and time machines, but for most of us, we''re simply trying to provide valuable products and solutions and make a little money doing it.</p>\r\n<p>Also, be wary of getting too good at something. Even if you were to bottle that lightning, all you''ve done is establish an expectation in the marketplace that you''re going to do it again and again. Apple''s stock is taking a hit right now even though its&nbsp;sales numbers remain&nbsp;the envy of every company in the world. Why? Because the company was&nbsp;so innovative for so long that any new release that doesn''t blow everyone''s collective mind is considered a failure.</p>\r\n<p>But again, that''s a bit of an extreme example. Let''s talk about how we -- the business leaders and entrepreneurs of the world -- bring the perceptions and realities of innovation a little closer together. How do we engage in the nebulous activity of "innovation," while avoiding the second edge of that sword and still meeting the needs of our existing and potential customers?</p>\r\n<p>For me, innovation is at its most powerful when it''s born out of a need to help someone. A business, a department, a team, an individual --&nbsp;whoever is having problems out there, let''s bring our minds together and find a new or more efficient way to solve those problems.</p>\r\n<p><span>Related:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/248537">5 Hidden Dangers of a Stereotypical Startup Culture</a></span></p>\r\n<p>Innovation has to remain customer-centric. While the population as a whole is more tech-savvy than it''s ever been, they still don''t move anywhere near as fast as we (the creators of technology and software) do. Not everyone wants to be an early adopter or is looking to constantly disrupt their workflows with the newest app, tool or feature.</p>\r\n<p>Instead, think long and hard about what tangible benefits a new feature or technology actually provides to those that you have the privilege to serve or sell to. I don''t want to make better things; I want to make better, happier, more efficient or more productive people. That mindset is what brings the idea of innovation alive for me.</p>\r\n<p>So yes, be innovative, but innovate toward the customer, not away from them. Find a new way to solve a common customer complaint, even if that solution itself isn''t the most innovative idea the world has ever seen. Challenge the status&nbsp;quo of areas of your business that you wouldn''t commonly consider innovation hotbeds, be it pricing models, customer support, even internal communication and collaboration processes, but only if it helps your organization better serve your customers.</p>\r\n<p>Always be deliberately and meaningfully customer-centric in the choices you make.</p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ll close with a paraphrase of Jeff Goldblum''s character in Jurassic Park: When it comes to innovation, don''t get so caught up in whether you can do something that you forget to stop and think about whether you should.</p>', 29, '1441358016.jpeg', '1441358017.mp4', 'news url', 1, '2015-09-04 18:13:37', 'unpublished'),
(343, 'Instagram Adds New Features to Direct Messaging', '<p>A couple of years ago,&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;launched&nbsp;Instagram Direct, a built-in messaging system that lets users share photos or videos with each other -- either one-on-one or in groups of up to 15 people. Now, with over 85 million monthly users, it''s time for Instagram Direct to get an update. That''s finally happening today with a few new features, which include threaded messaging and a way to share Instagram content as Direct messages.</p>\r\n<p>Threaded messaging is fairly self-explanatory -- instead of having to start a new message every time you want to send a photo or video to someone, you can go ahead and send them right in an existing conversation. You can also now snap a quick response photo in the thread itself and name your messaging groups if you want to differentiate one Direct message group from another.</p>\r\n<p>As for the kinds of photos and videos you can send, that previously only included your own content. Now, however, you can also share pretty much anything you see on Instagram -- perhaps a funny picture your friend took at a party or a video of cute kitten -- as a Direct message. You can do so by tapping a curved arrow (it''s located right next to the heart and comment icons) underneath the Instagram post. This will prompt open a Direct message window. Simply enter in who you want to get the message, hit send, and away you go. On the recipients end, when they see the sent image, they can tap it to view the original post. Aside from individual Instagram posts, you can share hashtag and location pages too.</p>\r\n<p>And don''t worry about people sharing any of your private photos -- your privacy settings will remain intact. Only those who are permitted to see the image will be able to see it, regardless of who the sender shared it with.</p>\r\n<p>So if you''re one of the 85 million people who are into Instagram Direct -- or maybe you want to try it out now that you know its new features -- the latest Instagram update will be available on both Android and iOS starting today.</p>', 29, '1441358097.jpeg', '1441358098.mp4', 'Youtube urlppppppppppppppppppp', 1, '2015-09-04 18:14:58', 'unpublished'),

Unfortunately it&rsquo;s just as sticky when it inevitably melts and drips all over your fingers. Lucky for frozen dessert lovers everywhere, scientists say they&rsquo;ve finally solved this sweet puddle of a problem, one test lick at a time.</p>\r\n<p>Yes, researchers at Scotland''s Universities of Edinburgh and Dundee have officially made the world a better place. As&nbsp;<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/11834053/Ice-cream-that-does-not-melt-could-soon-hit-the-shelves.html"><em>The Telegraph</em></a>&nbsp;reports, they created a special protein that keeps&nbsp;<em>cr&egrave;me glac&eacute;e</em>&nbsp;frozen longer, which, thank goodness, significantly slows down the summertime sadness known as melting. It also stops grainy crystals from forming in the dairy delight.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Related:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/236142">This Insane Ice Cream Changes Color When You Lick It</a></span></p>\r\n<p>The good news doesn''t end there. Unsexily scientifically named BsIA, the new anti-drip super ingredient also makes ice cream smoother, creamier and -- wait, what? -- healthier, too. That''s because it replaces some of the saturated fats and other stabilizers and emulsifiers commonly used to bind oil and water in ice cream. BsIA will help the chilly treat retain it shape and keep it from dribbling down your chin in hot weather, all without sacrificing taste, or so its creators claim. The ultimate cherry on top is fewer calories overall.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited by the potential this new ingredient has for improving ice cream, for consumers and for manufacturers,&rdquo; Cait MacPhee, the lead scientist on the project, tells&nbsp;<em>The Telegraph</em>. So are we. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>MacPhee says you shouldn''t worry that BsIA-enhanced ice cream is some kind of crazy chemical concoction. "This is a natural protein already in the food chain," she says. "It''s already used to ferment some foods, so it''s a natural product rather than being a ''Frankenstein'' food." Oh, goodie, we''ll take three scoops then.</p>\r\n<p><span>Related:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/248743">3D-Printed DNA ''Bunnies'' Could Deliver Drugs Into Your Body</a></span></p>\r\n<p>Sadly, the wonder ice cream does eventually crush your childhood dreams and melt, though not nearly as quickly as plain, old ice cream.

The anti-melting protein likely won''t be available for three to five years.

The Millan brand had plenty to bark about, with more than 8 million followers on Facebook and the popular&nbsp;<em>Cesar 911</em>&nbsp;TV series.</p>\r\n<p>But an audit of cesarsway.com, which sells pet products, books and DVDs and offers a wealth of pet-related information, showed that SEO issues weren&rsquo;t the site&rsquo;s biggest concern. Rather, it was suffering from a lack of focused content that, according to Rogers, kept it from delivering on its revenue potential.</p>\r\n<p>The challenge for Rogers and managing editor Rosalia De Azevedo was to find a tool to help leverage their content across multiple digital channels to engage visitors at various points in the purchasing journey. The duo realized that this fix went beyond well-trod paid SEO marketing vehicles to a broader content optimization approach called web presence management, or WPM.</p>\r\n<h2><span>The fix</span></h2>\r\n<p>After viewing a demo, Rogers and De Azevedo were convinced that the cloud-based Searchlight WPM platform from New York City-based Conductor was the right tool for the job. Unlike SEO tools that lean on paid positioning and advertising, Searchlight helps brands connect with key buying personas via nonpaid channels such as the company website, organic searches and social media&mdash;&ldquo;where most traffic comes from anyway,&rdquo; says Conductor co-founder and CEO Seth Besmertnik. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t reach everybody with paid ads. You need to find ways to get into the target customer&rsquo;s buying process earlier and to engage them across different channels with great content at key stages of the buyer&rsquo;s journey.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Searchlight crawls a client&rsquo;s websites and social networks, as well as competitors&rsquo; sites and search engines. It analyzes the data it collects and generates recommendations for content optimization. These can be general recommendations such as changing tags or photo placement to make pages more accessible to search engines, or they can get as granular as &ldquo;You should publish content about overweight dogs&rdquo; or &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have any early-stage content for people attracted to rescue dogs.&rdquo;</p>', 29, '1441358358.jpeg', '1441358358.mp4', 'Entertainment url', 1, '2015-09-04 09:31:16', 'published'),

The full version of Astropad lets you use your iPad as a graphics tablet, and now the company just launched a new version of the app for iPhone too.</p>\r\n<p>The new app is called&nbsp;<a href="http://astropad.com/iphone/" target="_blank">Astropad Mini</a>, and it''s going to cost $4.99 as part of its launch promotion on Thursday while the full price will be $9.99.</p>\r\n<p>A graphics tablet is a pressure-sensitive slate that photographers and artists use to easily edit photos on their computers. It allows you to control your computer mouse with a stylus on the tablet so that you can touch up photos with more precision.</p>\r\n<p>So, for instance, if you''re editing an image in Photoshop, you''d be able to move the cursor to edit intricate details of the photo using a pen rather than a computer mouse or trackpad.</p>\r\n<p>These tablets are usually pretty expensive, however.

The iPad app debuted earlier this year, but the company said it heard a lot of requests for an iPhone version too.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s going to open up access to a lot more people," Ronge told<em>Business Insider</em>.</p>\r\n<p>Like a graphics tablet, Astropad works by connecting your iPhone or iPad to your Mac so that you can mark up images using the touch screen on your iPhone or iPad. And, since the Astropad app mirrors what''s on your Mac''s screen, you don''t have to keep an eye on your Mac''s monitor while drawing on the tablet like you would with a cheaper graphics tablet.</p>', 29, '1441358421.gif', '1441358422.mp4', 'Youtube urlppppppppppppppppppp', 1, '2015-09-04 09:31:22', 'published');
